/** Read row number <i>row</i> of the Sequence. The values of the row

 supplied, rows are counted only if they satisfy that expression.

 Note that we can only advance in a Sequence. It is not possible to back up
 and read a row numbered lower than the current row. If you need that
 you will need to replace the serialize() method with one of your own.

 @note The first row is row number zero. A Sequence with 100 rows will
 have row numbers 0 to 99.

 @todo This code ignores the main reason for nesting the sequences, that
 if the outer Sequence's current instance fails the CE, there's no need to
 look at the values of the inner Sequence. But in the code that calls this
 method (serialize() and intern_data()) the CE is not evaluated until the
 inner-most Sequence (i.e., the leaf Sequence) is read. That means that
 each instance of the inner Sequence is read and the CE evaluated for each
 of those reads. To fix this, and the overall problem of complexity here,
 we need to re-think Sequences and how they behave. 11/13/2007 jhrg

/** Serialize a Sequence.

 Leaf Sequences must be marked as such (see DDS::tag_nested_sequence()),
 as must the top most Sequence.

 How the code works. Methods called for various functions are named in
 brackets:
 <ol>
 <li>Sending a one-level sequence:
 <pre>
 Dataset {
     Sequence {
         Int x;
         Int y;
     } flat;
 } case_1;
 </pre>

 Serialize case_1 by reading successive rows and sending all of those that
 satisfy the CE. Before each row, send a start of instance (SOI) marker.
 Once all rows have been sent, send an End of Sequence (EOS)
 marker.[serialize_leaf].</li>

 <li>Sending a nested sequence:
 <pre>
 Dataset {
     Sequence {
         Int t;
         Sequence {
             Int z;
         } inner;
     } outer;
 } case_2;
 </pre>

 Serialize case_2 by reading the first row of outer and storing the values. Do
 not evaluate the CE [serialize_parent_part_one]. Call serialize() for inner
 and read each row for it, evaluating the CE for each row that is read.
 After the first row of inner is read and satisfies the CE, write out the
 SOI marker and values for outer [serialize_parent_part_two], then write
 the SOI and values for the first row of inner. Continue to read and send
 rows of inner until the last row has been read. Send EOS for inner
 [serialize_leaf]. Now read the next row of outer and repeat. Once outer
 is completely read, send its EOS marker.</li>
 </ol>

 Notes:
 <ol>
 <li>For a nested Sequence, the child sequence must follow all other types
 in the parent sequence (like the example). There may be only one nested
 Sequence per level.</li>

 <li>CE evaluation happens only in a leaf sequence.</li>

 <li>When no data satisfies a CE, the empty Sequence is signaled by a
 single EOS marker, regardless of the level of nesting of Sequences. That
 is, the EOS marker is sent for only the outer Sequence in the case of a
 completely empty response.</li>

/** This method is used to evaluate a constraint and based on those results
 load the Sequence variable with data. This simulates having a server call
 the serialize() method and a client call the deserialize() method without
 the overhead of any IPC. Use this method on the server-side to 'load the
 d_values field with data' so that other code and work with those data.

 The somewhat odd algorithm used by serialize() is largely copied here, so
 comments about logic in serialize() and the related methods apply here
 as well.

 @note Even though each Sequence variable has a \e values field, only the
 top-most Sequence in a hierarchy of Sequences holds values. The field
 accessed by the var_value() method is a completely linked object; access
 the values of nested Sequences using the BaseType objects returned by
 var_value().

 @note Only call this method for top-most Sequences. Never call it for
 Sequences which have a parent (directly or indirectly) variable that is
 a Sequence.

/** @brief Mark the Sequence which holds the leaf elements.

 In a nested Sequence, the Sequence which holds the leaf elements is special
 because it during the serialization of this Sequence's data that constraint
 Expressions must be evaluated. If CEs are evaluated at the upper levels,
 then valid data may not be sent because it was effectively hidden from the
 serialization and evaluation code (see the documentation for the serialize_leaf()
 method).

 The notion of the leaf Sequence needs to be modified to mean the lowest level
 of a Sequence where data are to be sent. Suppose there's a two level Sequence,
 but that only fields from the top level are to be sent. Then that top level
 is also the leaf Sequence and should be marked as such. If the lower level is
 marked as a leaf Sequence, then no values will ever be sent since the send_p
 property will always be false for each field and it's the call to
 serialize_leaf() that actually triggers transmission of values (because it's
 not until the code makes it into serialize_leaf() that it knows there are
 values to be sent.

 @note This method \e must not be called before the CE is parsed.

 @param lvl The current level of the Sequence. a \e lvl of 1 indicates the
 topmost Sequence. The default value is 1.
