	Modified the build so that --std=c++-0x works on CentOS 6
	The issue was that the bison code failed to build. The fix is
	to not use the --std=... flag for it. Since it's generated code
	we're not using any C++ 2011 stuff. If that changes, it _will_
	build with 2011++, but not the 0x implementation found on CentOS 6.

2019-03-26  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Arrgh. C++-11 on centos 6 is broken or our code stresses it.
	Dropping back to, either we find c++11 support or we don't. Use
	CXX11_FLAG is non-zero to if it was found (and if so, how to get the
	compiler to use it).

	This runs under autoconf 2.63, but there's another hitch. Potential fix...

	DDS::get_das(): Added a test and fix for top-level 'value' attributes
	It's possible to have a DMR or DDS that has top-level attributes that
	are not in a container. These work in the DMR or DDS object, but not
	in the DAS (which can only have containers at the top-level). The
	'orphan' attributes are put in the DAP4_GLOBAL container, since these
	almost certainly come from DMR objects. We might revisit this name
	choice...

	Added tests for DDS::get_das() and get_das(DAS *).
	Also edited the implementaiton just a bit to test for global attributes
	that are not containers.

	Vector::vec_resize() are a stab at an explanation. The bottom line
	is that the fix is to use size() with resize() and not capacity().
	I also modified TestArray so that its read() method allocates
	enough space for a vector of Structures before it starts writing
	to it, just to demonstrate good behavior.

	The DAP4 ce parser was not removing double quotes or the %<hex>

	in it where /s in the id name were turned into dots and the

	Improved error checking for the DDX parser.
	When text is feed into the parser and its not valid xml, the parser
	was just ignoring that. No more...

	Arrg. baselines were not in the last commit...

	Moved the newest tests' baselines to the 'universal' directory
	It's time to switch the new DMR tests to ones that don't have to
	have a separate set of baselines for bin- and little-endian
	machines. It takes too long to build up the big-endian test
	baselines (get a b-e VM, etc.) and we have a good set of baselines
	for each arch so if issues pop up on one or the otehr arch,
	it should be easy to catch them.

	Merge pull request #18 from OPENDAP/jg_filters
	Jg filters

	Merge branch 'master' into jg_filters
	Conflicts: D4Sequence.h

	Added 'universal' tests for DMRTest
	The DMR includes a checksum when it's built from received data and
	that checksum is a function of word order of the sender. This made
	building baselines for the DMR tests a pain. We've built a number of
	tests for both big- and little-endian machines - from now on new
	tests should use 'universal' baselines (built by removing the checksum
	using sed).

2016-05-03  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Merge pull request #17 from OPENDAP/D4Sequence_value_ref
	Added a new method to D4Sequence

	Cosmetic editing

	Optimized the read_sequence_values() code.
	Child sequences do not have copies of the filter clauses. These are not
	needed by them since they have already been filtered.

	Added tests for complex CEs involving nested seqeunces

	Inner sequence filter issue resolved
	The code still needs tests and there is a potential optimization and
	the syntax needs to be documented because the way fields in a
	sequence can be referenced is less general than other places in the CE.

	Fixed the issue with child sequences in DAP4

2016-05-02  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Partial fix for Hyrax-182
	https://opendap.atlassian.net/browse/HYRAX-182

2016-04-29  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	More test baselines

	Scanner fix

	Fixed the numeric constant error with the filter code
	Numeric constants were showing up as the value '1.' The checking_*()
	functions were the culprit. In the process I added missing methods in
	the FilterClause code and debugging in a number of places.

	Added tests for the new filter code. Not all of the tests pass...
	There is some work to be done with parsing the != and ~= operators
	and also mixing int and float arguments. There may be issues with
	filed references as well, but we'll have to check the spec for that.

2016-04-25  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed the issue with <constant> <op> <var> not working.

2016-04-24  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed three operand filter clauses in the CE evaluator, but...
	they still don't work correctly. There seems to be a problem with the
	parsing of constants.

	Removed debugging statements; Using the 'ND' operator is an error.

	The parser now builds filter clauses and binds them to a D4Sequence.
	Some by-hand tests show not everything works, but mostly it's a problem
	with relops and String variables or constants.

2016-04-23  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Parser tweaks - relops now are returned as strings

	Fixed a problem with the TestByte, ..., classes when used for 'series values'
	Some of the classes had the odd behavior that the series of values
	was per-process and not per object instance. So, TestStr's value
	would not repeat until a new process was started, it instead kept
	increasing "... 1", "... 2", etc., across different instances of
	the class. Fixing this made it easy to fix the TestD4Sequence code.

2016-04-22  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added tests for D4Sequences, including filter clause evaluation

	Added D4SequenceTest

	D4Sequence now supports evaluating a FilterClauseList.
	Added tests too. I have only tested D4Sequence::intern_data(),
	not serialize().

	D4FilterClauseList now used by D4Sequence::serialize()

	Eh, I rewrote the relops operator code.
	It now uses the same approach that I used for DAP2 - a method
	for each type (Byte, ...).

	Added D4FilterClauseTest

2016-04-21  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed a bug in the was D4Function was used
	In the ServerFunctionList and d4_function_parser.yy, I should
	have been using a poiter to D4Function and not the object itself.
	Now the DMRTests for functions pass

	Hacks to the D4FilterClause code
	This also includes fixes to D4RValue and tests for the filter clause
	code. Two minor changes to the parsers.

2016-04-20  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Merge branch 'master' into jg_filters

	break setting the correct value for WORD_BIGENDIAN.
	See also https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=962091#c48

2016-02-18  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added long-needed const constructor and operator=()
	This was done to support some experiments with memory caching,

	Zero-length array support: Vector::serialize() traps calls when length() == 0
	This is part of a series of changes to support netCDF files
	that use zero-length arrays as arbitrary attribute containers.

	Removed old code that was commented out.

	Replaced fgets() > 0 with fgets() != 0 in the parser's main loop
	A suggestions from David Binderman.

2016-01-29  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Modified Vector::val2buf() in support of zero-length arrays
	val2buf() was throwing an InternalErr when called with a null data
	pointer. I modified it so that if the pointer is null and the length()
	of the vector/array is zero, it returns zero. The exception is still
	thrown if the pointer is null and the length() is not zero.

	Removed #define DODS_DEBUG

	Tests for empty DAP2 Structures

	Tests for empty structures added.

2016-01-28  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Zero-length arrays now work with libdap, with caveats

	Some of the DAP4-only types were not setting is_dap4

	fixed a warning in dmr-test - /* in a comment

2015-10-13  jgallagher59701  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added test baselines for intern_data with no checksum
	I dropped computing the checksum in the intern_data() method,
	so the baselines for the tests had to be updated.

2015-10-13  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Now the intern_data() method used with DAP4 does not compute the
	checksum It is only computed by the code that serializes the
	response - sends it to a remote client. I added baselines
	specifically for the intern tests on little endian machines. Will
	add ones for big endian next...

	Merge branch 'intern_no_crc32' of
	https://github.com/opendap/libdap4.git into intern_no_crc32

2015-10-12  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Removed crc32 generation from intern_data()
	This seems better - I think computing the CRC code
	when interning values is not necessary. Those should
	only be computed when the server is going to send values.

	Completed changes to D4UnMarshallerTest.cc
	This copy of the tests should work on both little- and big-endian
	hosts.

	More changes to D4UnMarshallerTest.cc

2015-10-12  jgallagher59701  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	One step closer to the tests working on big endian machines
	D4MarshallerTest now works

	Update to D4Marshaller/UnMarshaller tests - added baselines for
	big-endian ...There's still an issue, however.

2015-10-07  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	D4UnMarshallerTest also needs two sets of baselines. Added
	little-endian ones.

	D4MarshallerTest need two sets of baselines...
	One for big- and one for litte-endian machines. I made the little
	endian set.

2015-10-07  jgallagher59701  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Changed to D4EnumTest to support changes for big-endian machines.

2015-10-07  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	The change to D4Enum::compute_checksum() was correct. This fixes
	the last of the issues with Enum on big-endian machines. The
	problems we caused by the assumption that 64-, 32-, 16- and 8-bit
	integers would align on the LSB, which is the case for
	little-endian machines (but not big...). In several places where
	reinterpret_cast<>() was used I first assigned the Enum _value_ to
	a temp variable of the correct size and then passed the address of
	that to the checksum calculation function. High cost in one sense,
	but really, scalar Enum variables will be rare and Arrays of Enums
	are handled differently. I also have dropped the overly-complex
	design that used a union. It eliminated some casts, but was based
	on the erroneous assumption regarding alignment.

	Test change in computing checksum for big-endian machines.

	Debugging big-endian issues still..

2015-10-07  James Gallagher  <jimg@idoru.local>

	Merge branch 'endian_fixes' of https://github.com/opendap/libdap4
	into endian_fixes

	Cleanup of a version of this that should work on big and
	little-endian machines.

2015-10-06  jgallagher59701  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Baselines for Enum tests on big endian machines
	Now only the tests 54 and 55 fail on the big endian machines...

2015-10-06  James Gallagher  <jimg@idoru.local>

	Removed union in the D4Enum implementation
	This is an attempt to fix the issues found on big endian machines.

2015-10-01  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	The DMR tests now work on little endian machines, mostly
	There is an issue with D4Enum that causes some tests to fail.

2015-10-01  jgallagher59701  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixes for function/ce tests modified:   tests/DMRTest.at

2015-09-30  jgallagher59701  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Baselines for a big endian machine.

2015-09-30  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fail: fixed a syntax error that got pushed.

	Added capability to build baselines that's sane

	Continue with fixes for data + ce tests

	DMRTest is dependent on word order - this is a trial fix.

2015-09-29  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed an issue in HTTPCacheTest; version number bump.
	In HTTPCacheTest, a quirk of RCReader meant that when the tests
	were run as part of distcheck they would fail if the user has set
	USE_CACHE to 1 in their ~/.dodsrc. Version numbers bumped to 3.15.1.

2015-09-23  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/opendap/libdap4

	Fixed a syntax error in cgi_util.h
	... and added commentary to MarshallerThread.cc

2015-09-20  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Version 3.15.1

2015-09-18  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added empty Coverity model file

	Fixed a bug in the DAP4 CE evaluator
	The DAP4 CE evaluator was using just the stop index value
	as the size of a dimension when testing if the stride value
	was valid. When a dimension of length 1 (i.e., [0:0]) was
	found, it's length was '0' and a stride of '1' was invalid.
	I fixed this and the test now uses stop-start +1 for the
	dimension length.

2015-09-17  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	HTTPCacheTable uses verbose errors
	... instead of obscure error codes

	Modified configure.ac to fail if uuid.h is not found.

2015-09-16  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added #error if uuid.h is not found modified:   DODSFilter.cc modified:   tests/ResponseBuilder.cc

	Fixed a syntax error modified:   tests/ResponseBuilder.cc

	An attempt to fix the uuid.h header issues.
	I added a test to test for uuid.h in addition to uuid/uuid.h
	in the hope that it'll find something and compile. I may have to
	work on this a bit more since it's caused such a hassle on the
	different build systems.

2015-09-15  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Minor issue in D4EnumDefs.cc with range checking

	Added #include <cerrno> where needed

2015-09-14  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Minor fix for precision in Float64, other fixes.

	CID 81430, CID 81412, CID 81409, CID 81405, CID 81402, CID 81401,

015-09-10  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Updated files for the release of 3.15

2015-09-09  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Merge branch 'master' into parallel_io

	An error introduced in March has been fixed; Freeform tests now
	pass. Commit 6b005387 introduced a change where set_read_p() no
	longer tested the state of the is_synthesized property. Before, if
	the property was set the method would not change the state of
	is_read. The change made it so the is_read property was changed
	regardless of the state of is_synthesized. This broke the
	'projection functions' in the FreeForm handler. I have reverted to
	the old libdap behavior, and the tests now pass.

2015-09-04  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Removed the old serialize_no_release() method

2015-09-02  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Now has a special class for RAII on the lock in the child thread.

2015-08-31  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Cleaned out more dead code from Vector.cc

2015-08-28  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Updated the version number to 3.15
	This because of the parallel IO code and pipelining support.

2015-08-28  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Removed old code from MarshallerThread refactor.

	Moved the pthread code from XDRStreamMarshaller
	It's now in MarshallerThread and used by XDRStreamMarshaller via the
	'pointer to an implementation' pattern. This means that the pthread.h,
	which configure looks for but may not find, is not included in XDR-
	StreamMarshaller's header anymore.

	I did not mention this in the git log, but I've removed the
	serialize_no_release() method I added after refactoring the code
	so that it wasn't needed (I moved the 'release' calls to the BES
	dap module, so libdap's behavior is not changed).

2015-08-27  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added support for put_vector_part() to D4StreamMarshaller

	Refactor: CLEAR_LOCAL_DATA and USE_POSIX_THREADS
	We found that we could call clear_local_data() right after variables
	were serialized and get a much flatter memory profile. However, putting
	those calls in serialize() changed its behavior. I've moved them to
	bes/dap/ResponseBuilder - but that is controllable using a compile-time
	directive. Similarly, the compile-time switch USE_POSIX_THREADS
	can be used to turn off that feature (#undef). See XDRStreamMarshaller.

	Refactor: Parallel I/O methods
	I refactored the three new parallel I/O methods back into the matching
	put_vector() methods of the same/similar names. This cuts down on the
	naming mess and means that other classes like XDFFileStream don't have
	to include hacked methods that throw exceptions. This commit also
	includes changes that wrap the clear_local_data() calls in #ifdef
	CLEAR_LOCAL_DATA. Lastly, this refactor will also require a matching
	edit to ncml_module.

2015-08-24  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Patch/fix/hack for XDRStreamMarshaller
	This class' header requires pthread.h but that makes for issues since
	we cannot put an include of config.h in a .h file that is installed.
	To get on with testing, I'm checking in this version that just includes
	it; later on I may modify the class to encapsulate the pthreads stuff.

	Fix for clear_local_data() race condition
	Took advantage of the current XDRStreamMarshaller impl that copies
	data before writing it out. This means our code can delete the original
	data held by the object right after the thread used to send that data
	has been called (actually, it could delete it _before_ starting the
	thread, but doing so afterward keeps that feature out of the marshaller
	class, which may come in handy later on...). Later on we may switch
	to reference counted pointers and then this issue will go away.

	Removed call to clear_local_data() in Vector::Serialize()
	This was colliding with the call to clear_local_data() in the thread
	when put_vector_thread() was called. This showed up as a 'sometimes'
	failure of expr test #21. The bug happens only when serializing an
	array of structure that contains arrays.

2015-08-22  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Corrected a spelling mistake with 'serialize_no_release'

	I've added synchronization code to the XDRStreamMarshaller dtor
	This causes the XDRStreamMarshaller dtor to block on the d_out_mutex
	until the child thread (possibly) writing to the output stream
	completes.

2015-08-21  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added parallel_io to the set of branches Travis will build.

	Now threads in XDRStreamMarshaller are created detached state

	Added the new put_vector_thread methods to Marshaller
	I made them have a default implementation so that child classes
	won't break. I'm not sure if that's the best way to go...
	Also dropped the new *_thread() methods into Vector::serialize(),
	but they don't work so those are turned off by using #undef
	USE_POSIX_THREADS

	Parallel I/O for vector data maybe working
	I have coded put_vector_thread() and put_vector_part_thread() and
	they are passing unit tests.

2015-08-18  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Removed some of the TODOs in libdap
	[ci skip]

2015-08-17  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/opendap/libdap4

	Modified Vector::get_buf() so it can be used in the ncml handler

2015-08-17  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	Merged the new (template-less) version of Vector into master branch

2015-08-17  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Completed DAP2 put_vector_part() and associated methods.

2015-08-14  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	Typo

2015-08-14  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Partial Vector/Array serialization partly working!
	Must still implement the parts for Arrays of int16, ..., types;
	only byte arrays work now.

	Checkpoint: Adding methods to allow serialization of Vectors in parts.
	Missing methods in D4StreamMarshaller, XDRFileMarsahller and parts of
	methods in XDRStreamMarshaller.

	Added three protected accessors to Vector
	These provide access to the underlying data held in a Vector/Array
	and are accessible to descendant classes only.

2015-08-14  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	Replaced template methods in Vector.cc with more pedantic
	implementations. Made the templed methods private and used them in
	the implementations of the new pedantic methods.

2015-08-10  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Bumped up the version number to 3.14.2

	Bumped up the version (and SO numbers). This is 3.14.2

	Merge branch 'serialize_n_release'

	Added a serialize_no_release() method
	This rounds out the serialize_n_release branch. The new behavior of
	freeing the dynamic memory is very desirable, so it's the default,
	but if some code wants to serialize, do something else and then delete
	the storage, the new serialize_no_release provides that option. All
	of our libdap and bes/module tests pass. This will be merged to the
	master branch once the latter has been tagged.

2015-08-07  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed overwriting commit for Vector::serialize()
	We decided to make the serialize and release code real, but in the
	process that collided with changes to BaseType::name() (making it
	a virtual method). One line was broken, but since it was the call to
	clear_local_data() in Vector::serialize(), it was an important line!

2015-08-06  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	distcheck works locally

	Fix for distcheck and getdapTest

2015-08-05  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	make check now supports parallel execution
	Modified test/Makefile.am so that autotest parallel tests work. Run
	make check with TESTSUITEFLAGS=-jN

2015-08-05  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	pulled from github and merged conflicts

	Refactored use of the name() method in BaseType so that it is now override-able

2015-08-05  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added BaseType::clear_local_data()
	The clear_local_data() method is used to free just the parts of a
	BaseType (child of, really) that hold large amounts of data. It applies
	to only a handful of the variable types (Vector, Sequence, D4Opaque and
	D4Sequence). It is used to free memory right after data values are
	sent to the client using serialize(). This means that data are no longer
	held by the variable objects once serialize() returns - at least for
	Array, Sequence, ... Other types like Byte, Int16, ..., will retain
	their values because those values are not held in dynamically allocated
	storage.

2015-08-04  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Hacked the marshT unit-test
	I modified this so that it no longer relies on data being present after
	serialize() has been called. It seems that none of the handlers use
	this 'feature' and we can change the code so that memory is freed right
	after the bits are sent fir each variable. This means that only one
	variate's data are in memory at any given time.

2015-08-03  Nathan Potter  <ndp@opendap.org>

	Checking in change to _always_ release array memory after serialization. This causes the Marshaller test for Structure to seg fault.

2015-07-14  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Removed the bison version print out
	...I think this is working fine now
	[ci skip]

2015-07-13  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added distcheck to travis

	travis caching
	Modified travis.yml and install_libdap4_source_deps.sh so that
	the bison source build is cached.

	Another fix: added '/bin' to $HOME/bison in $PATH

	Removed odd ^S from install_libdap4_source_deps.sh

	More travis hacks - added sudo: false back in; remove tabs

2015-07-12  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	travis: The build was not triggered with the last push...
	... so try removing 'sudo: false'

	Switched travis to use docker/containers

2015-07-09  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added .NOTPARALLEL: back to the C++ parser Makefile.am files
	We need this because stack.hh, ..., are built in one shot by
	bison.

	Updated the library version

	Grammar fixes - for flex and its C++ scanner code.
	There is a conflict between the defined return type of
	FlexLexer::LexerInput. Some versions of flex define that
	method as returning an int and some a returning a size_t.
	Including generated code using one will break when a build
	machine uses the other. I used dist-hook to just 'rm' those
	generated lex.*.cc files  from d4_ce and d4_function - the
	other generated scanners are OK. This is really a work-around
	since we should be able to include the generated scanners
	and then drop the build requirement for both bison and flex.

2015-07-07  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added absolute-header-m4 and removed .gitignore
	I think the .gitignore is from the gnulib source
	and is fine for their git repo, but not for clients
	of the library.

	Changed the tag for non-master travis builds to _travis
	... from -travis. Minor, but it bugged me.

	Modified travis.yml so that branches ending in -travis will be built.

	Updated gnulib code - this may affect the coverity results

2015-07-02  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Coverity fix in dds.yy
	Fixed a potential leak where storage allocated is overwritten.
	An unlikely bug, but not a big deal to fix.

	Issues found using coverity fixed

2015-06-29  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed cppunit package for travis.yml

	Fixed a memory leak in dds.y

2015-06-26  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Minor syntax error in TestArray; Travis now includes cppunit tests

	Memory leak in TestArray.cc plugged

	More changes WRT coverity and travis
	...in the travis.yml. Removed the before_build_command
	stuff from the coverity scan addon section since it seems
	to be redundant.

	Added coverity scan to travis CI

2015-06-25  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/opendap/libdap4.git

	Issues found in D4ParserSax2, DAS and DDS using Coverity.

2015-06-20  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Finally fixed...?
	Using autoconf 2.69 make dist is building a tar-gz that includes the
	BUILT_SOURCES, which would be great for builders without bison 3. I'm
	not sure if that will work with autoconf 2.63.

2015-06-19  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Move the D4 Function parser to its own directory.
	This is an attempt to really fix the stack, position and location.hh
	problem for once and for all. The Travis build is working, but maybe
	we're just lucky because a build from the tar.gz made using make dist
	was still failing.

2015-06-18  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/opendap/libdap4.git

2015-06-18  Ubuntu  <ubuntu@ip-172-31-34-168.ec2.internal>

	Modified build-deb-pkg.sh so that dap-config matches the installed
	files.

2015-06-18  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/opendap/libdap4.git

	Try using NOTPARALLEL with the libdap build - another travis hack.

2015-06-18  Ubuntu  <ubuntu@ip-172-31-34-168.ec2.internal>

	Modified DEBIAN/control to use libcurl4-openssl-dev as a dependency.
	Not sure why this was not working before.
	[ci skip]

	Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/opendap/libdap4

	Added hackery script to DEBIAN directory.
	This will help with my simple deb file used for the bes build.

2015-06-18  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Modified Makefile.am and d4_ce/... so bison is called only once
	This should stop the semi-random build fails for libdap4 on Travis
	and for other people.

2015-06-17  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added .NOTPARALLEL to d4_ce/Makefile.am for the grammar files
	I hope this fixes the odd issue with the generated grammar files
	breaking hte build in a random fashion. The error may be do to parallel
	builds running bison several times for each of the generated files, all
	at the same time.

	Cleaned up the d4_ce code
	The Makefile.am had leftover parts from the attempt to make the build
	work when bison 3 was not present. That may have been the cause of the
	seemingly random build errors I see on Travis CI

	Added dpkg -l to travis.yml
	This is part of debugging the bes travis build - I cannot seem to sort
	out the libcurl dependency since my Ubuntu AMI is a 14.x but the build
	is using 12.x

	travis bison hack...

2015-06-17  Ubuntu  <ubuntu@ip-172-31-34-168.ec2.internal>

	Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/opendap/libdap4

	Changed DEBIAN/control arch to amd64

2015-06-17  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	travis.yml edits
	Now uses deploy section only for tagged pushes; removed unneeded
	--force-yes with apt-get; and will build tags in addition to the
	master branch.

	Fixed build-deb-pkg.sh and added 'deploy' section to travis.
	Not sure about the deploy bit...

2015-06-16  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Use newly built bison 3
	Added /usr/local/bin to PATH...

	Build bison from source (circling back)
	Travis-CI is currently using ubuntu 12 which using bison 2; Ubuntu 14
	has bison 3 in its package system.

	More tweaks to the simple deb package build
	This is a deb package for use with travis-ci when we get a bes CI
	build working

	Added debian package build to travis.yml
	...also tried using --force-yes to get bison to load with apt-get
	[ci skip]

2015-06-16  Ubuntu  <ubuntu@ip-172-31-34-168.ec2.internal>

	Added the build-deb-pkg.sh script.

	Added DEBIAN/control
	Use this along with dpkg-deb --build libdap_<version> to make a
	debian package.

2015-06-16  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Another change to the travis.yml file
	It now uses bison installed using apt-get

2015-06-08  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	travis-ci error fixed
	I left --prefix=... on the configure of bison but $prefix's definition
	was moved to a later step.

	Reorganization of the travis.yml script.

2015-06-07  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	clang...

	...another try at clang support

	...another try at clang

2015-06-06  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	minor tweak to 'make install' with sudo -i

	fix for clang

	more travis ci changes - learning what this can do...

	Added some package installs to travis ci

	travis ci fix

	travis ci: added install of libdap

	travis ci change: install bison 3 using sudo

2015-06-05  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Travis CI updates

	Added an initial .travis.yml file

2015-06-01  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added DBG2N - no line number version of DBG2

2015-05-24  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed comment

2015-05-14  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added a new function to make a temp file using mkstemps()
	This new function returns the temp file's name and a C++ fstream
	object that is opened to the temp file. This change adds to the
	libdap API.

2015-05-12  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed missing <string> include. Patch from O. Poplawski.

	Fix getopt() use. Patch from O. Poplawski

	Broke --enable-developer; now fixed.

	Fixed issues in configure and Makefiles reported by O. Poplawski.
	--enable-coverage and --enable-valgrind were broken.
	Setting CXXFLAGS to nothing broke builds on fedroa 21

	Added coverage file to gitignore

2015-05-01  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Formatting, old code removeal, doxygen updates

2015-04-05  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Bison 3 is required for the build.
	This might change, but for the next release (April 2015) it is a
	requirement for building the code. It will be possible to get the
	devel rpm and, however, and develop code that uses libdap w/o
	needing bison 3.

2015-04-03  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Bumped up the library versions
	Each of libdap, libdapclient and libdapsever likely have new interfaces
	but the old interfaces are intact, so CURRENT and AGE are increased,
	and REVISION is reset to 0.

	Various changes as needed for the release.

2015-03-31  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added to gitignore

	Hacked more for the FlexLexer.h kludge...

	Resurrected the D4*Scanner.h files

	Modified the FlexLexer.h scheme
	Now it fits more with the way I'm handling the other generated
	files. The header is in the generated files dir and is only
	copied out when bison 3 is not found. It's still a kludge...

	Added FlexLexer.h
	This might be a mistake - remove if this fails on linux, etc.

2015-03-30  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Rest of changes for template grammar files
	Now if bison 3.0+ is not found, the build will use
	template versions of the generated grammar files. This
	removes the dependence on bison 3.0 for most source
	builds. Of course, if you want to modify the D4 grammar
	you need bison 3.

	Added generated grammar sources
	When a machine does not have bison 3, it's a pain to install it, esp.
	at a site that doesn't let the builder do that! The work-around is to
	provide a backup set of sources that can be copied by the Makefile in
	lieu of the real thing.

2015-03-25  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/opendap/libdap4

	Dropped the autoconf required version to 2.63
	This accommodates RH/CentOS 6. I also had to change the AT_ARG_OPTION_ARG
	calls so that multi-word options used underscores and not dashes.

	Change to libdap.spec
	I've added the dist info to the RPM and fixed up some of the
	description, too.

2015-03-17  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Edited comments and reformatted.
	Also added a new method to Sequence that I subsequently removed
	from the code using the preprocessor. ...it might come in handy
	some day.

	Refactored TestCommon
	Now TestCommon.cc is not used; the constructors, etc. are now
	in TestCommon.h. In the future this class could be modified so
	that the 'series_values' property was accessible from TestCommon
	and not just the individual type classes.

	Change a comment emmited by configure less convoluted.

2015-03-16  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/opendap/libdap4

	Changes to build and to the Test* classes.
	Now configure tests for the uuid/uuid.h header (before it tested only
	for the library which meant that installing the libuuid package and
	not the needed libuuid-devel package would pass configure but fail
	during the build). I also removed some unused code from the Test* classes.
	The TestCommon.cc file was not needed.

	rpm target fixes
	Added getdap4 to the files list for RPM and fixed distclean/distcheck
	where some DMR tests are marked xfail (expected fail). With autotest,
	xfail leaves some cruft behind in the DMRTest.dir directory that
	./DMRTest --clean should remove (see the clean-local makefile target).
	However, because a space was added to the names in the Makefile.am,
	those --clean calls were not being made. Fixed. Somewhat exasperating...

2015-02-26  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/opendap/libdap4

	Added convenience function to util
	The new function extracts doubles from numeric arrays using a vector
	to cu down on memory management complexity (at the cost of an addition
	to the interface).

2015-02-21  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed GetOpt.cc includes
	This code used old includes (string.h, etc.) and was missing
	stdio. I added <cstdio> and changed stdlib.h and string.h to
	cstdlib and cstring. Removed a duplicate header. Build now works
	on AWS Centos 6.

2015-02-19  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	More Cleanup
	I re-indented TestSequence and removed some old code
	as part of my work on the aggregation server (which
	may not make it into the BES, another story...)

	Cleanup
	I removed unused code from Sequence, DDS.cc and AttrTable.cc

2015-02-09  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Tweaked D4Sequence for BES function's tabular()
	The d_length field is now set when set_values()
	is called.

2015-02-02  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Removed incorrect comment in Vector.h

2015-01-14  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added a type_name() function to util.cc/h
	In the merge with DAP4, type_name() split into D2type_name() and
	D4type_name(). That removes the symbol 'type_name()' from the library.
	I added a function with that name that first tries to apply D4... and
	then D2. If both fail, an exception is thrown. This provides forward
	looking backward compatibility.

	Fixed an issue with String constant arguments to DAP4 functions.
	The function parser for DAP4 was including the double quotes that
	delimit string constants in the value itself. I modified the parser
	to eliminate those.

2015-01-07  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	HTTPCacheTest was failing; fixed.
	The test assumed that the number of headers for a cached response
	would equal the headers in a response. This might not be the case.
	For example, the received response might include a Keep-Alive header.

	Error in D4Maps copy ctor fixed.
	This addresses an error in the DMRTest.cc unit test for the DMR
	class. DMR's copy ctor was failing to copy the maps from Arrays
	in the src object to the dest object because of an error in the
	D4Maps m_duplicate method.

	Corrected some comment text in DMR.cc

2015-01-05  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Minor changes to the Makefile.am files

2014-12-31  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Conflicts:
		unit-tests/HTTPConnectTest.cc

2014-12-12  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added eclipse meta files to gitignore.

	Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/opendap/libdap

	comment change in main_page.doxygen

2014-12-03  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added files  left over from a full build to gitignore

2014-11-19  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added .gitignore and hacked up Makefile.am so that it uses subdir-objects.

2014-10-21  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added a valgrind 'suppressions' file for OSX 10.9. Not sure where
	this is going, but valgrind for unit tests and regression tests is
	probably a good thing.

	Fixed to the Makefile.am in d4_ce so that the grammar for DAP4 builds correctly.

2014-10-20  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Changed HTTPConnect.cc on the release branch and then copied here. Minor fix in the test baseline to accommadate a change in the test host (etag changed with a change in the Apache server version).
	M    unit-tests/HTTPConnectTest.cc

2014-10-16  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed ticket 2260 - The issue where the DMR copy ctor built a DMR that would subsequently cause a segfault has been fixed. The problem was in Array::update_dimension_pointers(). The D4Dimension objects were not copied correctly between the old and new set of D4Dimensions in the Groups in the source and dest DMRs

2014-10-14  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Leak fix in the D4CE code - both the CE and Functions parser leaked memory - fixed. Tests HTTPCacheTest and HTTPConnectTest fixed - there were two issue with the new test.o2 server. Array.h - removed the D4Dimensions.h include.

	Bug fix in ServerFunction: The setFunction setters in ServerFunction were setting other function pointers to null so that the ServerFunction object could hold only one kind of function for any given name. If we want linear_scale, e.g., to work for both DAP2 and DAP4, the class has to be able to support a btp_func and D4Function. I fixed the ctors and setters so that works.

2014-09-17  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Renamed the bison 'Driver' classes to be D4ConstraintEvaluator and D4FunctionEvaluator. Added an eval() method to the latter so that the BES can evaluation DAP4 Functions in a some sort of a sane way. I also moved the old and crufty D4ResponseBuilder code out of the libdap dir; there's a class with the same name in tests, but it does different (and more sane) things.

	Comments and changed template type from 't' to 'T'.

	Comments...

2014-09-12  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed FQN() for Constructors that hold arrays.

2014-09-11  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	I removed the DMR& parameter to BaseType::intern_data(). This seems to be a relic from DAP2 (where it may not have actually been used either) and it makes employing delegation somewhat harder in the 'transmitter' handlers I'm working on porting over to DAP4.

	Modified to use the new 'DMR-free' version of intern_data(). Also fixed the help message.

	Added a DMR that holds a nested sequence so this can be tested - currently does not work and is not part of the tests.

2014-09-08  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Marked four tests a xfail. See ticket #2244
	M    tests/DMRTest.at

	I added specializations for transform_to_dap4() to TestStructure and TestSequence so that, among other things, the dapreader code can build DAP4 data responses using DAP2 response files.

2014-09-05  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed hiccup in Makefile.am that prevented the D4Connect.h header from being installed - it was not listed in pkginclude_HEADERS. Added subdir-objects to the options list in the Makefile.am too. Fixed an error message in getdap4 - text change only.

2014-09-04  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added a FQN() method that will return the FQN for any variable, including the group part. Also added a decent comment on the D4Group::find_var() method. Unit tests added to the D4GroupTest unit test.

2014-09-03  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Removed duplicate code in Sequence and Structure for the transform_to_dap4() method; moved the common code to Constructor.

2014-08-27  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added an update of the weak pointers held by Array so that the DMR::m_duplicate() method can use D4Group::ptr_duplicate(). This was useful when porting the gdal_handler code to DAP4.

2014-08-21  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Change to Constructor::serialize(). It now calls read(). This was removed because it broke the behavior of D4Sequence - at least in the test code (it still does). More work needs to be done on this, but the FreeForm handler, which builds sequences is working with D4Sequence (DMR/DAP4 Data via the DDS --> DMR hack). I will need to revisit this...

2014-08-19  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Now has a separate method to 'blend in' variables from a DDS into the DMR. This is used by the DDS-ctor for DMR but it can also be called on an existing DMR like the ones built by the BES. This was done so that information set when the BES builds the DMR won't be lost.

	Changes to the transform_to_dap4() method - both Sequence and Structure have implementations that work for tests and clients, but not most servers. Array should be pretty general and may work for most handlers.

2014-08-18  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Removed unused code - part of an aborted attempt to add a factory class as a param to BaseType::transform_to_dap4(...). Instead, it's likely better to subclass that method in the types like FFSequence (in the handlers). In the process I found a fair amount of old code that was commented out and removed it.

2014-08-15  James Gallagher  <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed an issue in Array where D4Dimensions made using the 'transform dap2 to dap4 code' with the same name but different sizes could be made. This was bad; I changed the code so that when a name conflict is found, the D4Dimension  will have a different name (made using the orig dimension name and the variable name). In this case, the fist D4Dimension gets to use the name exactly as it appears in the Array while the second D4Dimension gets a more cumbersome, but unique, name.

	Fixed the order of printing of attributes and variables for constructor types when working with DAP2 responses (i.e., the DDX). The order (attr; vars) is reversed in DAP4.

	Unit test updates after the OS upgrade from OSX 10.8 to 10.9.
	There seems to be an issue with the sizeof(std::string) and also
	with libxml2 and/or my code to read from a C++ stream and have
	libxml2 parse text/xml. For now I'm removing these tests... but
	will return to the libxml2 issue later (the sizeof(std::string)

2013-10-01  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Updated the FSF address in the copyright headers

2013-09-30  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	This checkin contains a fix for the conflicting definitions of
	width() in BaseType, Vector and Array, where Array provided a
	version/definition that clashes with the one in BaseType. BaseType
	defined width() and Array defined width(bool constrained = true),
	which shadowed the former. I changed BaseType width so that its
	signature is width(bool constrained = false) and made that the
	only version of the method. There are some changes to uses of
	width() in libdap and the BES, but not in the handlers.

2013-09-27  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	misc changes; a minor fix for Array; a fix for the DDX parser; A
	minor change in the scanners for the Error, DAS, DDS and CE
	parsers (added %option noinput to suppress a warning); removed
	-fno-defer-pop from the Makefile.ams.

2013-09-17  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	I changed the character used for the Type special form (from # to
	$, because # is a URL delim. and tomcat was filtering it).

	Removed the openssl/evp.h header because it winds up including
	des_old.h on OSX 10.5 and that has a conflict with set_key() in
	BESKeys.h. Also, the code no longer uses the evp.h header...

	M    XDRStreamMarshaller.h

2013-07-23  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Memory leaks fixed in the DAP4 Stream Marshaller classes - but
	these are in code in the trunk. will check in all the same and
	make corresponding changes to the code on the dap4 branch (which
	uses the filename prefix 'D4' instead of 'DAP4').

2013-07-23  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Modified ConstraintEvaluator so that it always frees the
	scanner/parser string buffer when an exception is thrown. I made
	this change while working on a problem that turned out to be in
	the scanner (state was not reset when an error was found) but even
	though this change is not the fix for that - see ce_expr.lex - it
	seems like a good idea.

2013-07-23  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed the rpm build - libtest-types.a was missiing from the spec file.

2013-07-10  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed a bug where a CE with mismatched quotes left the CE parser
	in the <quote> state, making subsequent requests fail. The fix was
	in the scanner to reset the parser (technically the scanner's)
	state to INITIAL when an error was detected. I also added code to
	catch the Error object thrown by the scanner and delete the parse
	buffer, although that might be overkill.

2013-07-10  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Merged changes from the miic_6.2013 branch. These changes support the
	new #<type>() special forms that enable big arrays to be use in CEs.

2013-05-17  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixes for ResponseCache - I added tests and have tested most
	modes. Not tested: how it works with server functions. There are
	also fixes/modifications for ResponseBuilder that ResponseCache
	uses. Added a note to ServerFunctionsList that it stores weak
	pointers. I worked on the ResponseBuilderTests but never got the
	test for server functions to work completely; the test examines
	the response document and checks that the metadata part is correct
	but not the (trivial) data part.

2013-05-17  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added get_next_mime_header() for an istream (the existing version
	took a FILE*) and moved some of the MIME header methods from
	ResponseBuilder here.

	Changes for libdap 3.11.7 so that when the CE Function cache
	directory is not present, caching is off. Before the code was just
	crashing when a function was used. I also refactored
	ResponseBuilder (where the fix is) so that it's got less
	redundancy.

	Changes so that users - handlers primarily - of libdap don't have to
	change their link libraries even though ResponseBuilder has the new
	caching code. The first version used Connect, this version uses hacked

2011-11-16  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	AttrTable was using id2www() to escape spaces and other characters
	in attribute names. This was done probably because of the
	spaces (spaces in the attribute names break the DAP2 DAS object
	parser), but no matter. It was breaking DAS and DDX objects
	because names with '%' characters in them were mangled. I replaced
	id2www and www2id with new functions that encode/decode only
	spaces. I have not fiddled with the find functions; it's fine to
	use names with spaces in them with the API, but the printed
	representation of the DAS will show those spaces as %20.
	Similarly, when the printed representation is parsed, those %20
	escape codes are replaced with real spaces. This means that the
	names in the binary objects and XML representation are correct.

2011-11-15  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fix for ticket 1841 - the xml attribute 'base' in the Dataset root
	element should have been preceeded by the namespace 'xml'. It is now.

2011-11-13  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed, I hope, the problem with the xmlTextWriter code in version
	2.6 of libxml. I think what was happening was really tripping over
	an odd feature of the xmlTextWriter API where the TextWriter
	object has to be freed before the pointer it has been writing to
	can be used. Actually, I suspect that freeing the object calls the
	buffer flush function, so calling that would probably work, too. I
	opted for the call sequence in the only example I can dig up...

2011-11-13  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fix for ticket 1837. The code libxml2 was escaping attributes with
	with OtherXML, turning them into useless goo. I switched from the
	...WriteString to ...WriteRaw function for this type of attribute
	and order was restored.

2011-10-21  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	I added a new method to DDS that can insert a variable anywhere in
	the DDS. I also added 'nocopy' versions of the new insert_var()
	method and the older ad_var() method. Once the ncml handler
	stabilizes, we can start using those methods to boost performance.
	Lastly, I forgot to add the new XMLWriter class on the last
	commit,

2011-10-12  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	I added a new method to BaseType, DDS and DAS: print_xml_writer()
	that takes a XMLWriter object and uses libxml2's xml writer API to
	build the DDX response. This should fix all of our woes WRT xml
	encoding. The new method is called by the DDS::print_xml method
	although it could be used in place of that method since it has the
	same parameters. I added tests and, in the course of that,
	modified the way some of the tests are done (using files instead
	of string variables for the regexs). I also tried adding some
	globbing functions to the util.cc file but those proved less than
	totally useful - I've left them there all the same.

2011-09-23  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fix for the unit test of get_request_size(). For this function,
	different compilers return different values for sizeof(string) so

Some of the mime_util code is used by the client side, however, and a tiny bit is used by the parts of ResponseBuilder I added so that the BES can use ResponseBuilder in those cases where there is no OLFS.

2011-02-08  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Reverted to pre-DAP4 hack versions of these... The new features are
	implemented in ResponseBuilder.

	M    DODSFilter.cc
	M    DODSFilter.h

2011-02-07  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	ResponseBuilder now assumes that the default protocol for a response is the DAP_PROTOCOL_VERSION read from config.h. This can be overridden using a parameter to the various set_mime_*() methods it defines (which are different from those in mime_util.cc). NB: These are not used by Hyrax, but the BES might use these sometimes and I've got mods pending in the BES to use this code.

	Corrected

2011-01-31  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Expanded DDS so that it's easier to get the protocol version string; moved the relevant MIME header code into ResponseBuilder on the assumption that someone might be using this still (like CEDAR). Updated the unit tests.

2011-01-29  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Leaner version of ResponseBuilder - the new replacement for DODSFilter.

	Merge from Hyrax 1.6.2 Shrew Release Branch.

	Not clear what the property modifications are, the ones I checked seem the same.  I'm just letting them go since they seem harmless.

2010-09-14  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed a bug in the www2id() function of escaping.cc that was causing symbols that start with a percent sign to be mangled. It's not clear why the server was/is using this, but this fixes the function and we'll have to sort out whether using the function is correct later. It may be that the BES is routing the DAS through an unnecessary cycle of print/parse/print operations.

2010-09-14  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added tests for www2id() and the case where an attribute starts with a percent sign.

	Spelling errors in GeoConstraint.cc

2010-09-14  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

2010-09-14  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Updated for fixes to a problem foud in initial testing of the server for the 1.6.2 release.

2010-09-14  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added a second version of eval_function_clauses() that takes and returns a DataDDS instead of a DDS. This enables easier use of the method in handlers that are using subclasses of the types and building responses from DataDDS objects passed around in the BES. I also updated some of the library version information in configure.ac to match more closely the addition to ConstraintEvaluator's interface.

	Grid now prints the XML declaration correctly when a constrained
	Grid variable's type decays to a Structure. The expr-test program
	now has an XML option (-x) for use with constrained DDS/DDX
	output.

	M    conf/libdap.m4

2010-04-22  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Modified the transfer_attributes code so that it checks the
	is_global property for individual attributes and
	containers (before it was just containers). This entailed a change
	to AttrTable in both the way it tracks and sets that property.
	Fixed the unit tests. Several tests became invalid because they
	tested handler-specific features that are now dealt with in the
	handlers themselves.

2010-04-22  mjohnson

	M    libdap.spec

2010-04-21  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Initial check in of the new methods to handle the transfer (copy)
	of attributes from the DAS to the DDS object. The new approach
	includes a new set of methods that are defined in BaseType and
	Constructor that are designed to be subclassed by handlers that
	build odd DAS objects. The default methods handle merging a DAS
	the follows the DAP 2.0 and later specs. The method in DDS calls
	these 'type-based' methods. The old approach is commented out
	using #if 0 ... #endif.

	deleted copy in Grid::add_var(). Ticket #1530 revealed this.

	Removed fdiostream from libdap and from the tests. Changed
	generalUtilTest to match the new version of id2xml()

2010-03-19  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	More changes for ticket 1521. Modified the id2xml() function so
	that it no longer encodes the stuff in an octal escape sequence.
	However, the value of the <value> element in the DDX _is_ encoded
	so that things like '<' will be escaped for the XML parser. Also,
	bumped the version in configure.ac to 3.10.1b. One unit test fails
	- this is a stop-gap fix so we can come back to that test and this
	fix later.

2010-03-19  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Modified Connect.cc so that the FILE_METHODS are used, which
	effectively removed the fdiostream.h header from the compilation.
	Also, the DAP version has been bumped to 3.3 - a fix since libdap
	included in the hyrax 1.6 beta release said 3.2 by mistake.

2010-03-19  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixes for ticket 1512. The function id2xml() was being used to
	encode String (DAP) Attribute values and this was causing problems
	when those values were not valid UTF-8 characters (e.g., when they
	were less than 0x20). As a fix we dropped the encoding altogether
	and fell back to the same encoding used by the DAS for the
	values (that encoding represents all non ASCII values using octal
	escape codes). I also fixed one of the unit tests that was
	explicitly testing for the XDAP header to be 3.2 and made it
	accept any value.

	DDS.cc: fixed minor memory leak

	Array.cc, Array.h: added prepend_dim function for adding outer
	dimensions.

	Grid.h, Grid.cc: added function to set the array part explicitly
	without copying it. fixed potential memory leaks. added a few
	extra checks on proper types being set. added function to add maps
	to (to beginning or end of map vector to support new outer
	dimensions). made _duplicate protected for subclasses to be able
	to call it.

2009-11-19  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	ticket 1399 - Grids that have only one member after projection
	still must be wrapped in a Structure (because there might be two
	Grids so projected and they might have members with the same names
	- this is a real case). The Structures provide for unique FQN as
	the DAP requires.

2009-11-10  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Removed libdapserver from the getdap link.

2009-11-05  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	I changed how the FILE_METHODS compile-time switch was defined,
	Now it's defined in the headers and not, directly in the config.h
	or *.cc files. That was a bug. All tests pass now. I'm going to
	check this in and then run tests on the entire shrew project.

2009-11-04  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Removed lots of accumulated 'old code' and reinstated the
	FILE_METHODS compilation flag.

2009-11-04  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Likely fixes for the win32 build. Test these on a vm.

2009-11-04  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	tweaks to get the ddx and dataddx responses working with the trunk
	BES. See getdap's -x (ddx) and -X (DataDDX) responses. These work
	using the -p x.y switch to set the DAP Accept version to x.y. Also
	added the -t option to turn on HTTP protocol tracing. The new
	parser DDXParserSXA2 reads the dapVersion XML attribute and sets
	the value in the DDS instance. I also modified the Connect class
	to recognize the dods_ddx and dods-ddx values for
	Content-Description.

2009-10-22  mjohnson

	Ticket #1442:

	o Fixed several potential memory leaks.

	o set_value now sets length.

	o Refactored cut & pasted sections to use helper funcs.

2009-10-07  mjohnson

	Made simple_find() and simple_find_container() public for callers
	that require non-recursing lookups.

2009-10-06  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	I fixed problems with two sets of tests. First, the "Array of
	structures with child arrays" test was failing because the
	TestCommon and TestArray classes were not generating valid output
	in the case where intern_data() was used. Second, the test for
	String regexes where nothing matched was botched because when a
	selection is applied to anything other than a Sequence and nothing
	is selected the response from the server is broken. This will be
	an issue for DAP4. In place of the test that used a Structure and
	selected nothing, I added two tests of Sequences with strings and
	tried both selections that return and don't return values. Both
	cases work.

	Vector.h, Vector.cc: Cleaned up and moved doxygen comments to impl
	file.

2009-10-02  Patrick West <pwest@ucar.edu>

	This function is no longer used in libdap and is specific to usage in
	dap-server. Moved the function.
	M    mime_util.h

2009-10-02  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Regarding the previous commit: On the IOOS branch I removed a 'bad
	fix' added at some point where includes within util.h supplied the
	class definitions for Byte, ..., Grid. So it looked like the .cc
	files were not including must at all, but in fact not only were
	they (and they need those includes) but _everything_ that used
	util.cc/h was too. So here are the includes, back in the .cc files
	where they belong.

2009-10-02  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Merged code from ioos/src/libdap rev 20393 that contained the
	'OtherXML' attribute implementation. This was apparently lost when
	that branch was updated between the commit of that revision and
	now. In addition to changes in AttrTable and the DAS and DDX
	parsers, there are changes in tests/ and unit-tests/. There's also
	a new function for converting octal escapes codes that is in
	escaping.cc/h. I updated the DDX parser to use the SAX2 interface
	and it now correctly processes namespaces and as a result, it's in
	a new file 'DDXParserSAX2.cc/h'. Oddly, when I performed the
	merge, an old 'feature' of the Type (Byte, ...) classes reemerged,
	the 'include the world' feature. In testing I could not get a good
	compile without these includes after the merge (but before the
	merge it was fine). I'm going to leave those changes out of this
	commit and see if the resulting code is OK. If not, I'l commit
	those changes, too.

2009-10-02  mjohnson

	Vector.cc, Vector.h: Added support for reserving data buffer
	storage in advance, clearing out data buffers, and for copying a
	Vector into a subset of the value buffer of another Vector. In
	support of aggregation to allow Vector's to be combined into a
	larger Vector. Ticket #1427 has more information. This was a
	monotonic interface addition and code change only --- no
	interfaces removed or changed.

2009-09-25  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Removed XDRFileMarshaller.h from DODSFilter.cc

2009-09-25  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	It just seem right to save things at this point. Most of the
	configure.ac files have been updated. The libdap software has had
	a number of the FILE* methods/functions commented out using #if
	FILE_METHODS and then #undef FILE_METHODS. We'll see how much of
	the redundant code can be removed before the next Hyrax 1.6
	release.

2009-09-25  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added fdiostream to the library because it seems we might be using
	it someday soon. Modified expr-test to use temp. files and the
	methods in DODSFilter and Connect - this is a better test of the
	library. I modified XDRStreamUnMarshaller a fair amount but it's
	still not work 100% and needs more error checking. This code still
	uses XDRFileUnMarshaller.

2009-09-22  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed a bug in fdiostream and added support for a istream that
	reads from a FILE* (ugh).

2009-09-18  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Uses the new file descriptor stream classes - that is, it tests
	both input and output.

2009-09-18  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added XDRStreamUnMarshaller to the Makefile.am

2009-09-18  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Build fixes for linux. Linux uses libuuid for the uuid functions
	while OSX does not - I added a test for that library to

2009-08-31  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Replace fgetln with fgets in DDXParser.cc.  oddly package.m4 in
	tests has the version number for the library. I changed that to 3.10.0
	(we should have something for the trunk better than a version number
	that looks like a release number) since I didn't think 3.9.2 was a
	good value...

2009-08-31  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Configure fixes.

	M    configure.ac

2009-08-31  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Refactor of libdap: AIS removed from build. In addition,
	bug tickets addressed for Array, DDS, Vector and parser-util.cc

2009-08-27  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Moved mime_util to libdap from libdapserver.

2009-08-27  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Removed unnecessary libdapserver use for the unit-tests after moving cgi_util to mime_util
	and putting the latter in libdap.

2009-08-27  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added code to build and read the DataDDX response for DAP4.
	Connect has request_data_ddx() and request_data_ddx_url()
	methods that will ask a server for the DataDDX and parse
	the returned response. Connect::read_data() can read a DataDDX
	response from a file; getdap -M - can read the DataDDX returned
	by besstandalone when it's asked to return a DataDDX. DODSFilter
	now has a send_data_ddx() method and appropriate functions are
	now in mime_util.cc/h to build and parse the multipart MIME
	response. I also refactored the code somewhat renaming cgi_util to
	mime_util and removing redundant MIME parsing code in Connect and
	HTTPConnect - now all the MIME header parsing is done by functions
	in mime_util. Since these are used by both client and server
	operations, that should be moved to libdap (from libdapserver).

2009-08-21  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Changed ID to Id to match the RFCs in the set_mime...() functions..
	Also removed the set_client_dap_version() method and the matching get
	methods - These were causing more confusion than anything else. Use
	set_dap_version() and the matching get methods.

	M    cgi_util.cc
	M    DDS.cc
	M    DDS.h

2009-08-21  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Changed ID to Id in the set_mime...() code to match the RFCs; fixed here in
	tests.

	M    unit-tests/DODSFilterTest.cc

2009-08-21  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed an error where getdomainname() can return nothing
	and not indicate and error. Now the default domain name
	is opendap.org in that case.

2009-08-20  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Updates for the DataDDX response. New values were added
	to the ObjectType and and EncodingType enums. DODSFilter
	now has a send_data_ddx method that can either supply just
	the body (as needed by the OLFS) or the complete message.
	Unit tests added in unit-tests.DODSFilterTest. In HTTPConnect,
	get_description_type() and get_object() were also updated.
	Lastly, I change the values of Content-Description slightly
	so they were a little less clunky and made the dap4 prefixed
	values use dashes instead of underscores.

2009-08-19  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Interim version of autogen.sh for our projects - fix the --force option.

	I fixed a lingering problem with HTTPCache where its per-process
	lock on the cache could not be obtained because the cache created
	by a previous process was not writable. I used umask(0) to solve
	that. I also made sure that sending a CE that constrains an array
	of structures in two different ways returns an error. Lastly, I
	removed old code from the Array class

	I changed the etag value used in the HTTPConnetTest so the test
	will pass. The file changed and thus the etag changed when we
	moved the test server.

2008-12-04  Patrick West <pwest@ucar.edu>

	curl.h is included in HTTPConnect.h, which is included in
	AISMerge.h, which is included in getdap.cc. So need CURL_CFLAGS.
	Not sure why this doesn't show up in other builds, however.

	M    Makefile.am

2008-12-03  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Commented-out the #if FILE_METHODS ... #endif preprocessor lines.
	For some reason these are breaking the library when FILE_METHODS
	is one (but not when it's zero). Anyway, the FILE* methods are
	needed for loaddap. I'm leaving the directives in as comments
	since maybe someday I'll figure out _why_ these broke the library.

	Always build with the FILE_METHODS compile-time directive true. This
	may cause problems...

2008-11-25  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Found more 'dataset' arguments, previously commented out, and
	removed them. Makefile.am fixes that may address some build issues
	seen by other people.

2008-11-25  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	I had previously commented out all of the places where the data
	set name was passed around to the various methods that evaluate a
	CE. Patrick has moved information about the data set name into the
	BaseType class so that a single DDS/DataDDS/DDX/... can be built
	from multiple files/data sets. Passing the parameter was
	redundant, so I commented it out. I completed the removal by
	deleting those comments.

	Fixed the libcurl and libxml2 tests in confgure.ac - they now
	test the values of the two programs correctly.

2008-11-06  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Minor changes that are part of a fix for ticket 975. The complete
	changes are not done yet since the tests are not all passing for
	the intern_data() methods (but do pass for the
	serialize()/deserialize() methods and it might be that the problem
	lies in the TestArray class and not in the libdap code outside the
	tests. See svn/tags/libdap/partial_975_fix and the ticket itself

	because the element Alias was not closed.

2008-09-25  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

2008-09-18  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixes for tests after moving test.opendap.org - some of the
	test files appear to be different (not sure I understand
	that, but it's true, they are). Also, minor fixes for the
	new DDX31 symbol and xml header info to fix build errors.

2008-09-17  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Moved get_type() out of ObjectType.h and into HTTPConnect.cc and
	changed its name to get_description_type() which is not only
	more accurate but also less likely to conflict with other functions
	(there are two other 'get_type()'s in libdap already). There are
	other related changes.

2008-08-01  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Minor fix in dds.lex - test for an error from fgets(). Closes
	ticket 1068.

2008-08-01  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed the expr-test tests - they were only running the
	intern_data() code and not the serialize/deserialize code. Also,
	removed use of move_dds() from expr-test as it is no longer
	needed.

2008-07-31  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	String attribute values are always quoted when the DAS is written

2008-07-15  Patrick West <pwest@ucar.edu>

	Problem where nested sequences not having any values selected
	because of constraint evaluation, so nested sequences aren't being
	pushed to the value stack. When coming out of parent_part_two to
	the end of parent_part_one, the stack is popped to get that
	sequences values. Since nothing was being pushed, the values for
	that sequence were being popped leaving an empty stack. So when
	top is called on an empty stack, caused bus error.

	Also, in Sequence.cc, a dynamic cast was being made to a Sequence
	variable called tmp. dynamic casts were called three more times in
	the method. These can get expensive, so removed the other dynamic
	casts and using first variable called tmp.

	Added and modified DBG statements.

2008-06-16  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Removed HTTPCacheTable::CacheEntry's lock since it was redundant

	removed it. Also, I backed out other changes but retained some of
	the added encapsulation added to the CacheEntry struct. I checked

	Read/Write locking in place. Ready to start changing over from a
	single index file to a distributed way of storing the entries.

2008-05-15  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Moved the locking of entries into the cache table class. This sets
	the stage for changes to the table implementation so that it can be
	stored on disk and not in memory.

2008-05-14  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	removed #if 0 after refactoring HTTPCache, HTTPCacheTable
	and CacheEntry. Tests now run.

2008-05-14  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	CacheEntry has not been encapsulated, but only to the extent
	that fields are manipulated with accessor/mutator methods.
	The basic logic is still exposed to HTTPCache.

	I Have refactored HTTPCache so that most of the operations
	on the index file and in-memory 'database' of the cache
	contents is now in the HTTPCacheTable class.

2008-05-09  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added HTTPCacheTable class. HTTPCache will now be refactored
	so that it makes all cache table accesses through this class'
	interface. See ticket #1114 and #1118.

	There are three changes in these files: 1. formatting;
	2. Grammar builds; 3. Security fixes. For the formatting
	changes some files just got messed up and I was sick of
	looking at it. Grammar changes amount to simplifying the
	builds of the lex and y files. Now the sed calls in the
	Makefile have been removed - commented out to be completely
	removed later. 3. Nothing major on the security front
	but I made some changes all the same.

2007-11-13  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixeed ticket #995. The problem was in intern_data_for_leaf.
	This problem was fixed by changing the way intern_data_for_leaf()
	worked, slightly. It was always popping the stack of `d_values`
	object pointers regardless of the return value of read_row().
	However, if no values are read then the call to
	intern_data_for_parent_part_two() would never be called and the
	d_values field of the child sequence wouldn't be pushed onto the stack.
	Hence the pop should not happen - because there's no child there to
	pop. I fixed this with a slight change in the code. The method now
	skips the while loop and subsequent pop operation if the first call
	to read_row() returns false. The while loop won't be run anyway,
	so the actual change is minor and eliminates an unnecessary test
	in the case where read_row does return false initially.

	All of the tests that are expected to pass now do.

2007-11-12  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Grid.cc: Changed the way the declarataion is printed by print_val()
	so that intern_data can use this too and work with the expr-test
	test driver.
	Sequence.cc: transfer_data_part_two() now uses intern_data() when
	it should in place of read(). Also, print_one_row() is now more
	flexible in the way it prints rows. Before it expected that the
	first row would alway be printed (because it assume that the row
	had been read by deserialize()). Now it checks to see if the row
	should be printed because it knows that intern_data() might be
	run and that method is working with local data - the first row
	might not satisfy the CE.
	Sequence.h: Formatting
	Structure.cc: Switched from transfer_data to intern_data.

2007-08-20  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Removed warnings about strict aliasing rules by adding
	Vector::void *value() and replacing calls to buf2_val()
	with it. See ticket #941.

2007-08-20  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Updates to a number of the doxygen comments.

2007-08-20  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed a problem in util.cc where the sense of size_ok()
	was backwards! Also rewrote parts of ce_functions.cc so
	that value() was used in place of buf2val() which is far
	better from a type-safety standpoint and removes a number
	of warnings about strict aliasing of types. Also fixed
	error in Error.cc where 'undefined_error' was used where
	zero (0) should have been used. Modified RValue"build_btp_args()
	so that the size of the arg list is added to the malformed
	args message.

2007-08-18  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Patch from Patrice Dumas that fixes the distclean target and
	repairs the spec file now that the generated grammar files are no
	longer included checked into subversion.

2007-08-17  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

2007-08-17  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	I removed the generated grammar files from svn (but put copies in
	the new 'grammarfile' subdirectory). Now, svn checkouts need bison
	and flex to build.

	Updated gnulib and fixed a memory problem in the GNURegex class
	(which should really be renamed to DAPRegex, but that would break
	other code). The problem was that to use the gnulib regex code the
	config.h header has to be included and the gl subdir must be
	searched. I moved the declaration of the regex_t field of Regex
	into the implementation file to avoid having config.h in a header
	that is installed in <prefix>/include. This fixes ticket #953
	which first showed up in libnc-dap.

	ce_functions.cc: Added a new version of get
	get_attribute_double_value() that takes a vector of strings
	and returns the value of the first attribute found in that
	vector. Also cleaned up the memory use in the linear_scale
	function so that function no longer leaks the new template
	variable. This was part of the fix for #660 (See also the
	checkin for Clause.cc from today).

2007-01-29  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Clause.cc: Added a call to set_read_p(true) in Clause::value
	so that handlers' read() methods will not try to 'read over'
	the values inserted to the variables by a CE function.

2007-01-29  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	GeoConstraint.cc: Minor formatting fix.

	Updates to comments.

2007-01-26  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	ce_functions.cc: Fixed ticket 659 where array data was not
	read when a relational constraint was not used. The bug
	crept in while making another fix (for the HDF4 handler).
	The problem was that Grid::read() was used to read the maps
	(bit not the Array) and as a side effect read_p was set for
	the entire Grid, not just the maps. I reset the Array read_p
	value; see ce_functions.cc

	(but it was used when getting data).

2006-12-05  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added comments to DDS and DataDDS about when it's OK
	to delete their type factories (only when you're done
	using the DDS or if you're about to switch to a new
	factory).

2006-12-05  Rob Morris <Robert.O.Morris@jpl.nasa.gov>

	Updated ChangeLog

2006-11-21  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed unescattr() in escaping.cc. Now the code works when there
	are several escaped characters or when the escapes are escaped.
	That is, this version can be used by the libnc-dap library and the
	result is code that passes all the nc_test tests for char and text
	attributes.

2006-11-12  Rob Morris <Robert.O.Morris@jpl.nasa.gov>

2006-11-06  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	configure.ac: I moved the DAP Protocol setting up where
	it's likely to be updated and not glossed over.

2006-11-06  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	getdap.cc: getdap now reports the protocol version in addition
	to the server version.

2006-11-06  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added tests for the new parameter VALIDATE_SSL

2006-11-06  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	HTTPConnect.cc, RCReader: The .dodsrc file now supports a
	VALIDATE_SSL option which controls libcurl's validation of SSL
	hosts and certificates. If this is set (the default), certificates
	must be signed by a recognized Certificate Authority and hosts
	must be properly named. Clear (set to zero) to get the old
	behavior from libcurl which does not perform this validation.

2006-11-03  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	HTTPConnect.cc: Modified so that gzip and compress are also
	accepted encodings.

2006-11-02  Patrick West <pwest@ucar.edu>

	Removed DODSResponseObject from the Makefile after removing the
	file from libdap. DAS and DDS no longer inherit from
	DODSResponseObject. New classes representing DAS, DDS and DataDDS
	were created in BES. M Makefile.am

2006-11-02  Patrick West <pwest@ucar.edu>

	Moved DODSResponseObject.h to the BES, naming it
	BESResponseObject. Created in BES three classes to represent DAS,
	DDS, and DataDDS. D DODSResponseObject.h M DAS.h M DDS.h M DDS.cc

2006-10-30  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	expr-tests for geogrid() and geoarray(): Fixed the tests so they
	work using the new notation which passed geo points using lat,lon
	as opposed to lon,lat.

2006-10-30  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Makefile.am: Removed the debug flags from AM_CXXFLAGS. -Werror
	really breaks the builds because of issues in the bison/flex
	code.

	Auto reset of Subversion properties

2006-10-27  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Constructor.cc, ArrayGeoConstructor.cc: Removed DODS_DEBUG

2006-10-27  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	DDSTest.cc: Removed compiler warnings.

2006-10-27  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	HTTPConnect.cc: Fixed a bug in save_raw_http_headers() where the
	test for the \r\n line terminator was broken (tested nmemb-1 instead
	of nmemb-2.
	Makefile.am: added a target for test coverage and added the debugging
	options to CXXFLAGS by default. Make sure to back this out before
	release
	Unit Tests: Fixed up warnings in the unit tests

2006-10-27  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	DDS.h: Added declarations for the new transfer_attributes()
	methods

2006-10-27  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Constructor.h: Added declarations for the new transfer_attributes()
	methods.

2006-10-27  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	BaseType.h: Added a little text to the ptr_duplicate() documentation.

2006-10-27  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	HTTPCache.cc: Changed the way the mutex which is used to protect
	the various methods is initialized.

2006-10-27  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	GeoConstraint.cc: Fixed two warnings, one about using a prefix
	operator with modulus and assignment back to the same variable and
	the other about field initialization order.

2006-10-27  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	DODSFilter.cc: Fixed the broken definition of send_blob(),
	not that it matters...

2006-10-27  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	DDS.cc: I removed the second attempt at transfer_attributes and
	started on a third. This one seems to work much better; see the
	tests in DDSTest.cc. This version takes the _dim attributes from
	the hdf4 server and bundles them with a Grid Map or puts them in
	a sub-container for an Array. This should not break libnc-dap while
	still preserving all the attribute data.

2006-10-27  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Constructor: Added code to merge attributes into a constructor.
	This method is called from DDS.

2006-10-27  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	ce_functions.cc: Removed unused parameters.

2006-10-27  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	ArrayGeoConstraint: Fixed a warning where one version of the
	constructor was not using all of its parameters.

2006-10-27  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	ArrayGeoConstraintTest: added

2006-10-27  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	DDSTest.cc, Makefile.am: Updated with tests for
	DDS::transfer_attributes.

2006-10-27  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added test data for DDS::transfer_attributes new new version.

2006-10-24  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	HTTPConnect.cc: Removed debugging.

2006-10-24  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	DDS.cc: Removed the 'sub table' code from transfer_attributes().
	getdap.cc: Added -X option to build the DDX on the client to simplify
	debugging (e.g., ticket 480)

2006-10-24  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Massive removal of exception qualifiers/declarations. I've left
	only the exception declarations in RCReader (which declare that
	no exceptions are thrown) and those for constructors. In
	HTTPConnect.cc:save_raw_http_headers() fixed a bug where headers
	were assumed to have \r\n terminators. That is true only for new
	servers. See ticket #631 for more information.

2006-10-24  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	cgi_util, DODSFilter: Made many params & methods const

2006-10-23  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed AISDatabaseParser.cc

2006-10-23  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	AISDatabaseParser.cc: Replaced calls to getLineNumber and
	xmlSAX2GetLineNumber with calls to one or the other depending on
	the library version. In some places the SAX2 API was used
	exclusively, in others the old API was used. The changes mean the
	new API will always be used OR the old API will always be used,
	depending on library version.

2006-10-23  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	DDXParser.cc: I put the call to xml2's getLinNumber() Back in the
	code since older distros don't have the newer library.

2006-10-20  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Closed some tickets for the server-side functions and added
	the version function.

2006-10-20  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixes for ticket 616: I added code to GeoConstraint that checks
	the bounding box to make sure it includes data and returns an
	Error if it does not. Also, the order of the bounding box lat and
	lon were switched to fit more with practice. The GeoConstraint
	method arguments were no changes, only the order of lat and lon
	passed to the geogrid() and geoarray() functions.

	Auto reset of Subversion properties

2006-10-19  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Baseline data for geoarray tests added.

2006-10-19  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Tests for geoarray: Added

2006-10-19  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added geoarray() which required changes to GeoConstraint and
	GridGeoConstraint (I created GridGeoConstraint and made
	GeoConstraint abstract). ce_functions.cc was also modified.

2006-10-19  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	ArrayGeoConstraint.cc: Added

2006-10-19  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Updated baseline for text.z3.exp (data.z3) after fixing
	GeoConstraint::find_latitude_indeces().

2006-10-18  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added data.61a-d

2006-10-18  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	GridGeoConstraintTest: Updated with a new test for
	find_latitude_indeces.

2006-10-18  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Updated the data.z? files given that the range selection behavior in
	GeoConstraint has been changed.

2006-10-16  Rob Morris <Robert.O.Morris@jpl.nasa.gov>

	GridGeoConstraint: Added

2006-10-13  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Removed DDS from GeoConstraint.

2006-10-13  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	HTTPCache.cc: Minor change to a comment.

2006-10-13  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Refactored GeoConstraint so that all the Grid-specific code is now
	in GridGeoConstraint (created/added GridGeoConstraint). Modified
	ce_functions so that geogrid uses the new object. Updated the unit
	tests. Added the new class to the Makefile.am

	Added tests to expr-testsuite for geogrid. Somewhat dubious
	at the moment.

2006-10-10  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	expr-test.cc: reformatted

2006-10-09  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	BaseType, RValue, et c.: Closed ticket regarding optimization
	of build_btp_args. Args are always BaseTypes and before they
	were always read. This could cause huge Grid/Array variables to
	be read when those were arguments to functions, even if the
	running the function would result in only a small part of the
	Grid/Array being returned. Now arguments are not read. If functions
	need values for the arguments, they must read them themselves.

2006-10-09  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	cgi_util.cc: Fixed a bug in set_mime_text where the wrong 'type'
	was returned. The type was always set to dap4_ddx.

2006-10-09  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	CEFunctionsTest: Paths easy to set for debugger.

2006-10-09  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	DDXParserTest: Turned off debug

2006-10-09  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	AISDatabaseParser: Replaced old xml getLineNumber with the newer
	SAX2 api call.

2006-10-06  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Vector: Added set_value() and value() methods.
	Updated docs

2006-10-06  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	ce_functions.cc: Now the linear_scale function will work for
	Grid Maps in the hdf4 handler.

2006-10-06  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Check point: I've modified Connect, getdap and ObjectType so they
	support a Connect::request_ddx() method. I've added a stream
	reader to DDXParser and am in the process of figuring out where
	the attributes are going!

2006-10-05  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	DDXParser.h: Added an intern_stream() method to read from a stream and
	updated the code (one function) to use the new SAX2 API from libxml2.

2006-10-05  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	DDXParser.cc: Added an intern_stream() method to read from a stream and
	updated the code (one function) to use the new SAX2 API from libxml2.

2006-10-05  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Vector.cc: Ran indent

2006-10-04  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	ConstraintEvaluator: Now uses a list to store the list of functions
	and the add_function() methods now overwrite functions with the
	same names so it's possible to provide specializations of the
	standard functions in ce_functions.

2006-10-04  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added value()/set_value() methods to Float32/64, Int16/32,
	UInt16/32 and Str.

2006-10-04  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	ce_functions.cc: Both grid and geogrid now use a little hack to
	read the map vectors of a Grid. The HDF handler cannot read the
	Grid Maps directly (maps on HDF are not really variables but are
	attributes instead). This hack involves setting send_p for the
	just the maps and then calling the Grid's read() method.

2006-10-04  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	ConstraintEvaluator: Now uses a list to store the list of functions

2006-09-28  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Clause.cc: Fixed up some comments.

2006-09-28  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	GeoConstraint.cc: Turned off instrumentation; removed throw()
	from declarations, fixed a problem with bad latitude constraint
	information that caused a fatal error (now it sends a message
	indicating how to fix the problem).

2006-09-28  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	DODSFilter.cc: Modified send_data() so that errors thrown by
	BaseType functions will be returned to clients correctly.

2006-09-28  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	ce_functions.cc, GeoConstraint.h: Removed 'throw(Error)' from
	declarations since C++ calls abort() when/if another type of
	excpetion is thrown, even if there's a catch() clause for it.

2006-09-28  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	ce_functions.h: Removed 'throw(Error)' from declarations since C++

2006-09-27  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Vector.cc: I made the instrumentation in the ctor and dtor
	'level two' statements so that the output would be less cluttered.

2006-09-27  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	GeoConstraint.cc: reorder_data_longitude_axis() now works.
	CEFunctionsTest.cc: Turned off debugging.

2006-09-26  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	GeoConstraint: Checkpoint; passes unit tests but still fails with
	a real dataset (COADS_CLIMATOLOGY). Problem with circular
	longitude axis.

2006-09-25  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	ce_functions.cc: The grid() function is now implemented so that
	geogrid() can use it to evaluate GSEs (ticket 569)

2006-09-25  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	ce_functions.cc/h: The grid() function is now a BaseType* function.
	CEFunctionsTests: Work with the new grid() implementation changes.

2006-09-24  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	ce_functions.cc: Removed old code that was getting in the way.

	GeoConstraint.cc: Fixed a buf in reorder_data_longitude_axis():
	off-by-one error when applying the first constraint (used
	d_lon_length instead of d_lon_length-1 for the end point).

	CEFunctionsTest: Added code to use TestTypes from the 'test'
	directory and generally fixed up the tests so they work with the
	new BaseType function version of geogrid().

2006-09-23  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Auto reset of Subversion properties

2006-09-22  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Modified TestArray so that it's possible to see that arrays really
	are subsampled. That is, if a constraint is set on an array,
	TestArray::read() will first allocate the whole array and then
	sample it, simulating a read() method that's interacting with an
	API that knows how to sample an array. Works only for two dims.

2006-09-22  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	test.c{0,1}: Added

2006-09-22  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Grid: Added get_array() which returns an Array* so the cast that
	was needed when using array_var() can be removed. I changed all
	the calls to array_var() to get_array() (DDS, ce_expr, ce_functions).

	RValue.cc: I removed the read() call when build_btp_args() builds
	an argument list. This change may break client software, but it means
	that variables are not complete read when they are passed to CE
	functions, which should be a big boost in efficiency when working
	with EOS Grids in geogrid().

	Added code in TestArray to make arrays with constrained values.
	GeoConstraint: Updates; almost complete.

2006-09-22  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	GeoConstraint: Added a new method and an enum to record the 'sense' of
	the latitude map (normal or inverted).
	Added tests for the find_latitude_indeces() method to the unit tests

2006-09-21  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	GeoConstraint/geogrid checkpoint.
	Byte,Str: Added value() and set_value() methods
	TestArray: Improved the read() method so it uses the series_values
	property and so it returns reasonable values for lat/lon vectors
	expr-test.cc: Now can be used to test BaseType functions

2006-09-20  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	libdap.spec: Patch from Patrice Dumas regarding the libdapserver
	and libdapclient libraries.

2006-09-19  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	dap-config.in: Changed the semantics of --libs so that it matches
	the old behavior.

2006-09-15  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Updated the version to 3.7.2 and the associated ChangeLog,
	configure.ac, et c., files. The docs have also been updated
	(docs/html.tar.gz).

2006-09-15  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	HTTPConnect.cc: Changed the way headers are parsed. Now the code
	assumes that each header is terminated by a \r\n pair (previously
	the code assumed the line terminator was a \n character only).

2006-09-15  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	HTTPConnectTest: Fixed most, but not all, of the failures. See
	ticket 552 for more info.

2006-09-15  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	test.f.exp: The change to TestStr so that the number included in the
	string increments broke this test. Fixed.

2006-09-15  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Sequence: Doxygen was complaining about the types used in the
	new transfer_data_*() methods because they were not exactly the
	same string (vector<Sequence*> versus sequence_values_stack_t).
	I made them the same.

2006-09-15  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	doxy.conf: Now the method listings are in alphabetical order.

2006-09-14  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	SequenceTest.cc: Now tests the new transfer_data() method.

2006-09-14  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added the transfer_data() method to Sequence. This method reads
	data using the read() method and loads values into the local object's
	d_values field. Values can then be used by methods like print_val()
	which expect to see information stored in the Sequence objects
	as if the object was part of a client and had read the data off of
	the wire. I also modified the print_vals_by_row so that nested
	Sequences values are indented by four spaces.

2006-09-14  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	TestStr.cc: Modified the string so that the value of count
	increments by one for each instance.

2006-09-14  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	TestInt32.cc: Modified so that on 64-bit machines the overflow of the
	'* 32' operation does not reset the value of _buf to zero, but instead
	_buf cycles back to 32.

2006-09-13  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Sequence: Added transfer_data and related methods. These are used
	to move data on the server-side from a data source into the
	d_values field, loading the variables in the sequence with data in
	a way that is very similar to the operation of all the other
	variables. This provides a way to pass a DDS to other code which
	is loaded with data. SequenceTest.cc and Makefile.am in
	unit-tests: Test the transfer_data method. Int32: I added a
	value() method similar to those added to Float32/64 a while back.
	This simplifies testing so much... configure.ac: Bumped up the
	revision number of the library.

2006-09-08  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	GNURegex: I change the regex_t field from a regular variable to a
	pointer. Seems to fix the problem, although I don't know why. Not
	the most reassuring feeling...

2006-09-05  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	BaseType.cc: Modified add_var() so that it now throws an InternalErr
	and fixed up the documentation so it reads correctly.

	Auto reset of Subversion properties

	function model. Now it's a pure projection function.

2006-09-01  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	GeoConstraint: removed old code and modified find_lon_lat_maps()
	so that I can test with the COADS dataset. Tests not working...

	checkpoint: GeoConstraint/geogrid() nearly working Changes in
	DDS, ConstraintEvaluator, ce_functions (now uses the new libdap
	namespace), RValue, various tests.

2006-09-01  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Updates/Changes to the grid() testsuite that uses remote servers.
	I changed the tests so they now run using servers on test.opendap.org
	and use getdap (the tests were originally written to use geturl).

2006-08-29  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	GeoConstraint: Changed code to do the data translation for split
	constraints so that it uses memcpy(). Untested.

2006-08-28  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	GeoConstraint: Added some of the code needed to swap parts of a 'split'
	longitude constraint.

2006-08-21  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	DDS.cc: Fixed tcket 480. The transfer_attributes() method
	was not handling the HDF4 *_dim_? attribute containers
	correctly, at least as far as the libnc-dap was concerned.
	Now those attribute containers are made subtables of the
	associated variable. That is, if there's a variable <var>
	and a container <var>_dim_0, then the attribute table
	<var> will have a subtable 'dim_0'.

2006-04-18  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	expr-test.cc, tests/Makefile.am: Tests updated for changes in DDS,
	DODSFilter, et cetera.

2006-04-18  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	DODSFilter: Modified so that this class now takes a ConstraintEvaluator
	object in the places where needed.

2006-04-18  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	DDS: Removed the constraint evaluator and the send() method.

2006-04-18  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	BaseType.h and it's child classes: Now the serialize() method
	takes not only a DDS but also a ConstraintEvaluator object.

2006-04-18  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	ce_expr.lex, ce_expr.y, ce_expr.tab.{cc,h}: Added files that
	contains a modified ce parser. This parser takes two objects as
	input: ConstraintEvaluator and DDS. The old parser took only the
	DDS.

2006-04-18  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	ConstraintEvaluator: Added this class. Now the ce evaluator is separate
	from the DDS object.

2006-04-18  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Clause.h: Added private methods for the const ctor and operator=
	so that default versions would not get called by accident.

2006-04-18  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	cgi_util.cc: Removed the do_data_transfer() function. Use DODSFilter.

2006-04-18  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	ce_functions.cc: Minor change to the func_length code. It no
	longer uses the 'constants' vector in DDS to store the BaseType
	used for the return value. The caller can easily free the storage.
	Also, this function is never used!

2006-04-18  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	INSTALL.AIX: Fixed spelling and added a note about not bugging
	Martin or assuming he's going to guarantee the steps will work.

2006-04-18  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Makefile.am: Now builds the ce_expr parser in place of the expr
	parser. There's no real difference in the grammar accepted by the
	new parser, but ce_expr takes both the ConstraintEvaluator and
	DDS objects, where the old one took only the DDS.

2006-04-18  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Operators.h: Now uses the ce_expr parser header.

2006-04-18  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	parser.h: Removed the GSEClause include that I'd commented out earlier.

2006-04-16  Rob Morris <Robert.O.Morris@jpl.nasa.gov>

	Rename, add dirs and prune as appropriate for VC++ port

2006-04-04  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Auto reset of Subversion properties

2006-04-03  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	gse_parser.h: Added. This holds parser info used by the grid() ce
	function. The contents of this file were originally in parser.h, which
	holds definitions for the DAP parsers. Moving the info about grid()
	here maens that the grid() code can be part of the dapserver library.

2006-04-03  Rob Morris <Robert.O.Morris@jpl.nasa.gov>

	Edit 'scalar deleting destructors' out of win32 module def's

2006-03-31  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	For ticket 307 I modified the build so that three libraries are
	made instead of just one. The libdap library now contains only
	classes used for the DAP2 implementation. The client and server
	support code is now in libdapclient and libdapserver. Many files
	were modified since I trimmed the includes so that classes in
	libdapclient don't include headers in libdapserver and vice versa.

	NEWS: Spelling...

2006-03-14  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Updated ChangeLog, configure.ac, libdap.spec and NEWS for version
	3.6.2

2006-03-14  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	I changed the way DODSFilter handles the compression sub-process.
	The class was caling waitpid on the child process which was blocking
	even after the child had exited. I found that calling fflush on
	the FILE* where teh server is writing the response is sufficient
	to guarantee that all the data from the compressor is written w/o
	using waitpod. This is a fix for ticket #335

2006-03-10  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added a new public method to Connect read_data_no_mime() which can
	be used to read from a file. This method read a DAP2 data object
	from a file but does not try to parse MIME headers before reading
	the data. I modified getdap.cc so that it uses this when reading
	from a file that's not stdin.

2006-02-27  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Updated documentation files (README, NEWS, ChangeLog), version information

2006-02-23  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Removed most $Log$ entries since they are not supported by
	Subversion. Will do the rest tomorrow...

2006-02-23  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Removed all the method overloads that used const char *
	parameters. Those methods were added so that the Pix objects,
	which were passed as void*, would not get called with character
	strings by mistake. Since the Pix methods are gone, these are no
	longer needed.

2006-02-21  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	I fixed the constructors for both PipeResource and StdinResource
	so that the parent class and fields were initialized in the
	correct order. I also fixed up the documentation for
	DODSResponseObject.

	commented out DataDDS constructor that doesn't take BaseTypeFactory

2006-02-15  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	DataDDS.cc: Added a call to protocol_string_to_numbers in the
	constructor. This sets the internal protocol version numbers so
	that calls to Sequence:: deserialize() work (they now use the
	protcol version number to select the correct algorithm for reading
	from the stream instead of the server version).

2006-02-15  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	AttrTable.cc: Corrected a problem in add_value_alias where looking
	for attributes could cause a segmentation fault. The problem was
	that AttrTable::find() was setting the return iterator to
	attr_end() for the AttrTable object it returned as a value-result
	parameter (so the test to see if the iterator was pointing to the
	end needed to be done using that table and not the calling object.

2006-02-14  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Modified the print_xml method in Constructor and grid. It no
	longer prints anything for variables that are not part of the
	current projection when printing the constrained ddx. This works
	because the DDS::mark method marks the parents of projected
	variables.

2006-02-13  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

2006-01-24  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	The ostream I/O was removed and many files were modified. The code
	is still present inside #if 0 ... #endif preprocessor lines.

2006-01-23  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	All unit tests updated to work after removing the iostream
	functions/methods.

2006-01-19  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added protocol version to the library. The version number is set
	in the configure.ac file. I've modified the unit tests so that
	they work. I've also removed (#if 0 ... #endif) all of the MIME
	header functions which used the C++ iostream stuff (which is part
	of the task to remove deprecated code).

2006-01-12  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Updated ChangLog

2006-01-12  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	DDS.cc: transfer_attributes used odd logic and an unneeded

	expr-test.cc: changed new exception code to use fprintf() (it was
	using cerr).

2006-01-12  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	GSEClause: Removed the old, unimplemented, methods that were
	supposed to take the grid() function subexpressions. Fixed up some
	comments in the class as well.

2006-01-12  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	cgi_util.cc: In remove_mime_header() \n was used as the MIME
	header separator when CRLF should have been used. Since the rest
	of the code was fixed for 3.5.3, remove_mime_header() didn't find
	the separator. This broke the HTML form response.

	Installed GNU indent code formatter to eclipse and used it on
	expr-test.cc

2005-12-27  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	In expr-test, the function parse_mime() did not test for the new
	CRLF line terminator. This caused an infinite loop. Fixed. I also
	added a comment to cgi-util.cc noting that if the CRLF constant is
	changed, then the one in expr-test.cc should be changed too. Since
	the test code is, well, test code, it doesn't seem like the
	constant should be moved out into one of the header files. The
	CRLF constant is really used only by the cgi-util code.

2005-12-27  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Removed regex.loT

2005-12-23  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

2005-12-23  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Removed the send version method body and replaced it with a call
	to do_version() in cgi_util.cc. This consolodates the code that
	writes HTTP headers to one file.

2005-12-23  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Changed all calls to fprintf that write parts of the HTTP resonse
	header so that they terminate lines using CRLF pairs and not just
	LF (\n or 0x0a). I also fixed the spelling of Content-Type (the
	'T' in 'Type' was not capitalized).

	Auto reset of Subversion properties

2005-08-19  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Updated libdap.spec so that it now requires libcurl 7.10.6 (a
	downgrade from 7.12.0 so that we can build RPMs on RHEL3). This
	seems to work just fine. Also fixed up the HTPPCacheTest unit test
	so that it works the first time with a new check out.

2005-08-19  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	downgrade to libcurl-7.10.6. This seems to work but needs more testing

2005-08-17  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Another shot at getting the build to work...

2005-08-17  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Build fixes; rpms now split into plain and -devel; fix for
	libdap.m4 macro

2005-08-16  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	describing the macro.

2005-08-16  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Commented out the set of CFLAGS/CXXFLAGS (which was a left-over
	from the non-automake build).

2005-08-15  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Updated for the release of 3.5.2.

2005-08-12  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added back.

2005-08-12  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Test delete

2005-08-11  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	config_dap.h --> config.h; also removed TRACE_NEW, #pragma
	interface/impl. in test and unit-tests.

2005-08-11  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Removed trace_new.h; use valgrind instead.

2005-08-11  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Removed #pragma interface/implementation

2005-08-11  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	So, I added IteratorAdapter.cc back in again.

2005-08-11  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Hmmm... Eclipse still doesn't seem to get the deletes quite right.

2005-08-11  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Tests updated for new float32 and 64 value computation.

2005-08-11  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Changed how sequential values are generated. The values should be
	the same on 32 and 64-bit machines.

2005-08-11  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Updated...

2005-08-11  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	I removed the DODS_GTAR and DODS_PERL calls; Added AC_DEFINE for
	two version sof libxml2 and stripped away some code that was
	commented out months ago.

2005-08-11  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Resolved conflicts & added some comments about the state of the
	test driver.

2005-08-11  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Clarified commentary.

2005-08-11  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added conditional compilation of the XML SAX callback struct. The
	code now uses the library version number to determine which fields
	should be included since later version have additional fields.

2005-08-11  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Removed unused params in methods as reported by gcc 3.4. This may
	break gcc 3.2, we will see...

2005-08-11  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Removed unused params in methods as reported by gcc 3.4. This may
	break gcc 3.2, we will see...

2005-08-10  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Changed comparison in set_max_size() so that it uses ULONG_MAX
	(since the method uses a long) and does not test for negative
	sizes (since size is unsigned).

2005-08-10  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Moved debug options from AM_CXXFLAGS. Set the CXXFLAGS environment
	variable (sample values are assigned to CXXFLAGS_DEBUG).

2005-08-10  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	commented out #define DODS_DEBUG 1

2005-08-10  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Reverted to previous version (which uses long instead of int). The
	change breaks the unit tests (which otherwise work on both 32- and
	64-bit machines.

2005-08-10  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added

2005-08-10  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Latest and greatest eclipse/cdt settings...

2005-08-10  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Addressed various warnings from gcc (compiled using -Wall -W
	-Wcast-align) as part of making the code 64-bit clean.

2005-08-10  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added default init of TestCommon in the copy ctors for the
	TestByte, ... classes.

2005-08-10  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added proper error return to all unit tests.

2005-08-10  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Now GNURegex uses exceptions (std::invalid_argument and domain_error)
	to signal problems. Controlled using USE_EXCEPTIONS. If this passes
	on the nightly builds, then remove GNUerror.cc and builtin.h.

2005-08-10  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed read() method: It did not include the 16-bit int types int
	he switch statement.

2005-08-08  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed a leak where a specialization of BaseTypeFactory was used
	but not deleted.

2005-08-08  root

	Auto reset of Subversion properties

2005-07-28  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Changes for the OS/X build. Particularly for the regex code in gl.

2005-07-25  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed; the macro was using ifelse and m4_syscmd/m4_sysval but
	these didn't seem to be working. Also replaced obsolete AC_TRY_TUN
	with AC_RUN_IFELSE().

2005-07-23  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added libdap.m4: A macro that other packages can use to check for
	the library. From Patrice Dumas.

2005-07-22  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Updated requirements for automake, et cetera.

2005-07-22  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Updated for automake 1.9.6.

2005-07-21  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Removed calls to OK() in the set_error_code() and
	set_error_message() methods since these are called by the parser
	on partially built objects.

2005-07-20  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Improved the documentation of BaseTypeFactory; removed
	DEFAULT_BASETYPE_FACTORY from Makefile.am; added a note to
	util.cc:prune_spaces questioning if that function is still needed;
	added a test of prune_spaces to generalUtilTest.

2005-07-20  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Removed DEFAULT_BASETYPE_FACTORY switch. Updated build files using
	autoreconf --install --force (using automake 1.9.2 from FC3).

2005-07-19  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Updated cdtproject file. Should this be in SVN?

2005-07-19  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added gl/m4 to EXTRA_DIST; needed to get the distcheck target workig
	with automake 1.6.3. Newer versions of automake set this correctly
	given that ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS is used.

2005-07-18  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Removed $(top_srcdir) from ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS since this breaks
	autoreconf.

2005-07-18  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Changed ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS from '-I gl/m4' to '-I $(top_srcdir)/gl/m4' to
	fix one last problem with distcheck.

2005-07-18  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Applied Patrice's patch for unit-tests; make distcheck should now work.

2005-07-18  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Changed the cache dirs with initial values to <cache>_init and use
	the cleanup.sh script to cp -r <*>_init <*> to restore them. This
	way the tests work w/o svn.

2005-07-18  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added blurb about using autoreconf to (re)build the autotools stuff.

2005-07-15  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Updated Makefile.am and the README/INSTALL/NEWS files. The 'dist'
	target now works for make (although 'distcheck' fails for an odd
	reason).

2005-07-15  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Moved/Added

2005-07-15  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Moved the unit tests from 'tests' to 'unit-tests.' The unit tests
	are now only run when you cd into unit-tests and use make check.
	This change was made because those tests use network services
	which might not be present on some hosts used to build the
	package.

2005-07-15  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	More fixes for the tests

2005-07-14  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed again...

2005-07-14  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Removed extra line. This hosed the test since it causes the
	HTTPCache class to think there's a second zero-size entry.

2005-07-14  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	AISMergeTest now works (required files are now installed on
	test.opendap.org). Also, applied Patrice Dumas' patch for the
	Makefile.am.

2005-07-13  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed HTTPConnectTest

2005-07-13  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Spec file now includes support for a separate devel package
	(commented out). From Patrice Dumas.

2005-07-13  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	expr-test tests x, xa, xc, y, ya, and yc now expect to fail (and
	do on 64bit hosts).

2005-07-13  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	The last fix for this file? I hope so...

2005-07-12  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added data files for tests in DDSTest. Bug 112.

2005-07-12  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	mistakenly removed alloca_.h from svn. Fixed tests/cache_testsuite.

2005-07-12  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Test updates: expr-test now works except that 6 tests fail on
	64bit machines. Also, I updated the gnulib replacement functions
	so that gnulib-tool can be used in the future to update. I moved
	the gnulib functions into the 'gl' subdir and put the m4 macros in
	there inside the subdir 'gl/m4.' There's a note about the
	procedure to use to update the functions in INSTALL.

	Removed.

2005-07-11  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	My previous fix for the gnulib mktime bug was bogus since it left
	a replacement copy of mktime in the library using that name (which
	is reserved). I've stopped using the gnulib mktime for now since
	it doesn't seems absolutely necessary.

2005-07-11  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Modification from Patrice, et al. These were part of an attempt to work
	around a bug with using mktime but they did not work.

2005-07-08  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Moved all tests to the 'tests' subdirectory. There are some tests
	that are broken; only expr-test seems broken now but was not
	before. Most of the broken tests require a localhost web daemon
	and specific test files for it to serve; configure
	test.opendap.org for these instead.

2005-07-08  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Removed use of the GPL regex-0.12 code and switched to gnulib
	(which provides regex and other functions which are covered by
	LGPL). These turned out to be fairly massive changes. The work was
	done by Patrice Dumas (Thanks!). I removed a AC_DEFINE macro in
	m4/mktime.m4 to work around a compilation problem when using
	gnulib's mktime.c replacement function.

2005-07-06  Patrick West <pwest@ucar.edu>

	Added methods to Connect class to connect with the given URL
	instead of building the URL to connect with, such as adding .das,
	.dds, etc...

2005-07-05  Rob Morris <Robert.O.Morris@jpl.nasa.gov>

	Set eol-style to native on all text file in the trunk

2005-07-05  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed the library version numbers. The order was backwards for the
	last two digits.

2005-07-04  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added Patrice Dumas' patches for libtool, et cetera.

2005-07-01  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Moved the unit tests into the tests subdirectory.

2005-07-01  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	After adding libtool support, I ran autoreconf --force --install
	which in turn ran libtoolize. this updated a number of the support
	code for the build. Added ltmain.sh.

2005-07-01  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added. These generated files should be in svn.

2005-07-01  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added support for libtool using a patch from Patrice Dumas.

2005-07-01  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Set exec

2005-07-01  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	ModifiedMakefile.am so that the dejagnu_driver.sh script now works.

2005-06-30  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Automake changes; these work and build the tests. the DejaGNU test
	support has not been tested yet but the unit tests all run and the
	dejagnu drivers all build.

2005-06-30  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Switched to automake. Not complete but functional.

2005-06-30  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Applied patch from Patrice Dumas for the automake build.

2005-06-22  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Added for automake build

2005-06-22  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Started work on an automake file for this code; only partly done.
	The library builds but nothing else is in place. The grammars are
	in progress. They build but the way gse is handled is the the way
	they all should be unless I can get automake's lex/yacc rules to
	work. See Makefile.am.in_progress and configure.ac.for_am. Also
	included in this check in is a patch to libdap.spec from Patrice
	Dumas.

2005-06-22  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Remove the attempts to utilize automake's support for bison/flex
	introduced in the past 9 revisions.

2005-06-20  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed the source path.

2005-06-20  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Commented out the Patch: and %patch lines since the patched code is
	now in svn.

2005-06-20  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Accepted patches from Patrice Dumas <pertusus@free.fr> which
	improve the build by using the system's regex library if found.
	Also included in the patches were improvements to the rpm spec
	file; the file now uses the fedora template and includes a fix for
	Mandrake ('Tue' --> 'Tues' in the change log.

2005-06-15  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Fixed configure so that it does not include -gstabs on OS/X.

2005-06-15  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Changed eol-style, mime-type, other properties. Removed generated
	files from svn. Modified configure.ac so that it tests for bison
	and does not use bison -y.

2005-06-15  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Generated... Should these even be in SCM?

2005-05-23  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Removed cast to int at tokenlength = ... to avoid a warning about
	differring pointer and int sizes on x86 64-bit CPUs.

2005-05-23  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Now uses local common-tests.exp and test.opendap.org.

2005-05-23  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Tests now use the local copy of common-tests.exp.

2005-05-23  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Reformat using indent and indent-eclipse plugin.

2005-05-12  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Modified install so that it no longer appends a version number to the
	static library or includes. When we build a dynamic lib, look into the
	version number thing then.

2005-05-11  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	5/11/05

2005-05-10  James Gallagher <jgallagher@opendap.org>

	Changed to work with rpm. Don't alter the values of variables like
	$includedir because values for these are passed into make by
	rpmbuild, overriding the values set by the here. This was
	happening with $includedir which had the string '/libdap' appended
	early on in the Makefile and then @PACKAGE_VERSION@ appended in
	the install-header target. When 'make' was run from the command
	line, this worked OK, but not when rpmbuild passed in a new value
	for $includedir.

2005-05-10  James Gallagher  <jimg@zoey.opendap.org>

	* libdap.spec (Prefix): Built spec file; tested. Some problems
	remain, mostly that the curl and xml2 packages are not part of
	the RHEL3 dist! I'll have to sort that out before this dist
	mechanism becomes a reality.

2005-04-15  James Gallagher  <jimg@comet.opendap.org>

	* Removed include of config_dap.h from HTTPCache.h. This is the
	only header file in the library that includes the config header.
	Removing the include means that users of the library never see the
	library's internal configuration. There's a potential problem with
	this, however, in that users of the library must now use
	opendap-config --cflags when building _or_ define HAVE_PTHREADS_H
	themselves. I can make this last requirement go away if pthreads
	becomes required for libdap++ (then the code won't need the
	compile time symbol).

2005-02-08  James Gallagher  <jimg@comet.dods.org>

	* Merged with release-3-4-10

2005-02-08  James Gallagher  <jimg@comet.dods.org>

	* bumped the version up to 3.4.10; tagged.

	* System upgrade to FC3/gcc-3.4; minor fixes for the build.

2005-01-28  James Gallagher  <jimg@comet.dods.org>

	* Merged with release-3-4-9.

2005-01-27  James Gallagher  <jimg@comet.dods.org>

	* Added code to Test* classes so that Sequences are easier to
	test. These classes now return values similar to Nathan's DTS code
	on the Java module (although not exactly the same).

	* Fixed the way Sequence CEs are handled when Sequences are
	nested. Tested to three levels deep. The serialization code in
	Sequence is nw quite complex.

	* Incremented version to 3.4.9; I've made some changes since the
	last version and I need these in the trunk to test.

2004-07-07  James Gallagher  <jimg@comet.dods.org>

	* Merged with release-3-4-8FCS.

2004-07-06  James Gallagher  <jimg@comet.dods.org>

	* Bumped the version to 3.4.8.

2004-07-02  James Gallagher  <jimg@comet.dods.org>

	* I removed (commented) the pragma interface/implementation lines.
	This increases the size of the library by ~1MB, which seems pretty
	insignificant at this point. The change means that the code will
	compile on HP/UX with gcc 3.2. It _may_ be that gcc 3.4 fixes this
	problem, but it seems that the pragmas cause more headaches than
	they are worth. It should be easy to 'add them back in' if we
	decide to do that, since they are just commented out. 

2004-03-11  James Gallagher  <jimg@comet.dods.org>

	* Bumped the version to 3.4.7.

	* I fixed a problem in SignalHandler and RCReader. Both od=f these
	class had code that re-initialized a pthread_once_t mutex in their
	delete_instance() method. This was used by some unit tests to make
	a delete instances of these two singleton classes. The problem is
	that while this runs (sort of, we had some reports of
	crash-on-exit behavior) on Linux, it fails outright on Solaris. As
	Rob M points out, it's a non-standard use of pthreads. I removed
	the re-init and changed the unit tests. 

2004-02-18  James Gallagher  <jimg@comet.dods.org>

	* Merge release-3-4-2FCS.

2004-02-16  James Gallagher  <jimg@comet.dods.org>

	* Other fixes:
	The DBG() macros now include namespace std declarations.
	Used valgrind to isolate some memory leaks; others remain and this
	will be an on-going process.
	Made sure all calls to delete also set the pointer to null; this
	fixes some dual-delete bugs.
	Some of the doxygen comments have been improved.
	Fixed places were the switch from strstream to stringstream was
	botched. 

	* Fixed the following bugs since version 3.4.5:
	696: Infinite loop in the HDF4 server (w/character variables).
	698: libdap++ now returns better error messages when the httpd
	reports an error.
	692: The info response now works.
	695: The client-side cache is more robust. It does not leave cruft
	around when a user interrupts a program.
	691: Error responses were not parsed/processed correctly when
	received by clients in some circumstances. Now they are.

2004-01-30  James Gallagher  <jimg@comet.dods.org>

	* usage.cc: Fixed bug 692. Only one global attribute and one
	variable were output. The cause: ends operators left over from the
	strstream code...

2004-01-22  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Added namespace std declarations to some files. The DBG() macro
	uses cerr and thus the std namespace or std::cerr must be declared
	for newer compilers.

2003-12-08  Yuan Ho  <yuanho@ucar.edu>

        * Merge release-3-4 into trunk.

2003-11-10  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Added the methods Float32::value() and Float64::value(). I think
	the DAP should have a suite of methods which return values w/o
	using the awkward void pointer scheme. These methods (will) require
	a downcast unlike the void pointer methods. But they wind up being
	much easier to use in situations where you know the type of the
	BaseType object (which seems to be most of the time, in practice).

2003-10-03  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* I changed Connect's request_das, ..., methods so that they now
	treat a response that lacks a Content-Description header
	identifying the response as one of ours as a fatal error.

	* I Fixed what seems like, in hindsight, a bug. The scanners were
	treating illegal characters as non-fatal errors and writing
	messages on stderr. In reality the scanners should have been
	flagging those responses as bogus. Also, the scanners were using
	exit(1) when they found a fatal error; I changed that so they now
	throw an Error object.

2003-09-19  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Fixed bug #655. Here's how the DAP library looks for the RC
	file: First it checks the env variable DODS_CONF, then HOME. If
	neither is set it uses default values and disables the cache.
	Here's how DODS_CONF is used: If it is the name of a file that
	exists, use that as the RC file. If DODS_CONF names a directory,
	look in that directory for a file called '.dodsrc'. If that file
	exists, it uses it, otherwise try to create it using default
	values *except* that the value of CACHE_ROOT is the directory part
	of DODS_CONF with '.dods_cache/' appended. If DODS_CONF is not set
	to any value, the code looks at HOME and applies the same rules as
	for DODS_CONF (except that HOME should never be the name of a file
	so some of the rules don't really apply). We may need to tune this
	code for WIN32.

	Note that caching is off by default and a .dodsrc created by the
	library will have USE_CACHE set to zero. Users must actively turn
	caching on by editing the RC file.

2003-09-08  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* HTTPConnect.cc (fetch_url): Fixed bug #661.

2003-08-29  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Added a new property to BaseType which can be used to
	differentiate between variables that must be read by a server
	because they are in the projection and those which must be read
	because they are used in a selection clause or as a function
	argument. Previously we were using the send_p property for both
	these and it was causing problems when CEs contained both
	projected variables and functions (see bug #657). The new property
	is called 'in_selection' and is true if the variable is part of
	the current CE's selection or is used in any type of CE function.
	Servers should ensure that if their read() method implementation
	test send_p before reading data they also test in_selection. Data
	values should be read it *either* property is true. This fixes bug
	#657.

2003-07-28  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Added support for Digest authentication. There's also potential
	support for NTLM and GSS-Negotiate authentication, but I don't
	have any way to test those. 

2003-07-24  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Added a new test driver called server_handler. It's much more
	like a server's handler executable; combine it with geturl reading
	from stdin to make tests. See also sh-testsuite. Nascent but still
	useful. 

	* DDS:send() has been incorporated into DODSFilter::send_data() as
	part of a refactoring of DDS.

	* Timeouts are now smart.

2003-07-23  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Added a timeout mechanism to the server and modified the Test*
	classes so this is easier to test. Right now it's a pretty
	rudimentary thing. However, the timeout can be set in the newly
	expanded dods.rc configuration file. In the future when we have
	reliable Error delivery this code will send an Error object that
	explains that there was a time out, et cetera. Check out the
	ChangeLog in DODS/etc for information about the expanded dods.rc file.

2003-05-15  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Removed the List class/datatype. We've talked about this for
	months (years). Done.

2003-05-13  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Modified DODSFilter so that it takes a new switch, -o, which can
	be used to tell a handler which object is to be returned. Handlers
	can now be built which return all of the responses; the
	DODS_Dispatch CGI module tells the hander which response to
	generate. 

2003-04-21  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Merged release-3-3-1.

	* The RCReader class now supports using the environment variable
	DODS_CONF to point toward a dodsrc file. The value of the envar
	supersedes the default ~/.odsrc.

	* In HTTPCache: changed catch(...) clauses so that they explicitly
	name exceptions. The code was catching and re-throwing exceptions
	and in methods where the types of exceptions were caught this
	caused abort to be called, even when the re-thrown exception was
	one of the declared types.

	* Several bugs in the grid() function were fixed. First, the
	function was not checking to make sure that map vectors using in
	the selection sub-expressions passed to grid() actually existed.
	Also, the mechanism used to read values of variables used as
	arguments to CE functions was broken; constructor types were not
	completely read but *were* marked as though they were. Look in
	RValue for the latter fix.

	* Some of the unit tests included code that wouldn't compile with
	gcc 3.2.x; fixed. I'm now using gcc 3.2.2 for development (but
	nightly builds also continue with 2.95.3 and VC++ as well).

	* Added methods to DAS, AttrTable and DDS so that an integer index
	can be used to access variables and attributes. This was done so
	that the idl command-line client could iterate over instances
	without actually having to work with C++ iterator objects.

	* IteratorAdapter is no longer templated. This change was made to
	accommodate the MS VC++ compiler. Also, doxygen comments have been
	added to the code.

2003-01-23    <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Made release 3.3.0. Not merged since there were very, very few
	changes. 

2003-01-22    <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* I changed the source files so that they are clearly covered by
	the GNU Lesser GPL.

2003-01-10    <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* NEWS: Added.

	* Merged with changes tagged release-3-2-10 (from the release-3-2
	branch). 

2002-08-08    <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* I Replaced the single VirtualCtors.cc file, which had a virtual
	constructor for each of the data type classes in it (see Meyers
	for a discussion of virtual ctors), with a set of files with one
	virtual ctor per file. The old VirtualCtors.o file was *not*
	included in the libdap++ library because of link-time problems it
	would introduce. The new files *are* included. For any of the
	data type classes you specialize, you must provide a virtual ctor
	that returns an instance of your specialization. For any of the
	data types you do *not* specialize, the library will use the
	default virtual ctor.

	* The library libdap++.a is now `apartment thread safe.' The
	phrase comes from Microsoft's documentation; it means that the
	library can be used in a limited sense with MT software. The limit
	is that objects created using the library cannot be shared by
	threads. A MT program can create several instances of Connect, for
	example, but each instance can only be used by a single thread.

2002-06-21    <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Connect.cc: Fairly extensive additions to Connect's interface.
	The old interface is still supported, but its use is deprecated.

	* VirtualCtors.cc: Added this file. It can be linked with clients
	so that they don't have to provide definitions for the NewByte(),
	..., NewGrid() 'virutal constructor' functions. This will work
	only for those clients that don't need to subclass the various
	types. There maybe a better way to do this; either use a real
	factory class passed to DDS or by putting each of the New*()
	virtual ctors in its own file and adding those to the library.
	That way the linker will only extract them if they are needed. 

2002-06-11    <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* expr.y (process_array_indices): Arrays and Grids can no longer
	be partially constrained (those constraints didn't work).

2002-06-10    <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* das.lex: Added '*' to the set of chars allowed in a WORD. Same
	for dds.lex.

2002-06-05    <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* usage.cc: Modified so that option inforamtion passed in by
	DODS_Dispatch.pm gets passed onto the filter programs (see bug 453).



2002-06-03    <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Sequence.cc (print_all_vals): Removed Sequence::level and
	set_level() methods and the private _level field.

	* dods-limits.h (DODS_ULONG_MAX): Added U suffix to unsigned
	numerical constants.

2002-05-31    <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* das.y: Bug 450; The reserved word attributes can now be used as
	an attribute name.

2002-05-28    <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Makefile.in: Geturl is no linked without the Test* classes. This
	demonstrates that libdap++ can be used without subclassing. Look
	at geturl.cc for an example. Of course, there are limitations on
	what you can do without subclassing the data types...

	* geturl.cc: Geturl no longer links with the Test* classes. It was
	modified so that it can use the versions of the classes that are
	part of libdap++.a (which is a recent change to the library). The
	geturl.cc file now contains the `virtual ctors' used by the
	library to instantiate the instances of the various variables.

2002-05-26    <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Connect.h: Removed code specific to the GUI-based progress
	indicator. 

	* Error.h: Removed code specific to the GUI-based progress indicator.

2002-05-22    <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Byte.h, Byte.cc, ..., Grid.h, Grid.cc: It is no longer necessary
	to subclass the data type classes when building a client.

2002-05-10    <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Connect.cc (www_lib_init): Joe Sirott found and fixed a bug when
	making (many) multiple requests.

2002-05-09    <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* BaseType.cc (read): This method is not longer abstract.

	* usage.cc (main): Fixed a bug triggered when PATH lacks `.'
	
2002-04-30    <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Merged with release-3-2-9

2002-04-03    <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Makefile.in (binary-tar): Fixed binary-tar target.

	* BaseType.cc: Added using std::endl and ::ends

2002-04-02    <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* DDS.cc: Fixed broken use of using std::strstream.

	* Connect.cc (server_handler): Fixed bug 416.

2002-03-27    <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* usage.cc (write_global_attributes): Fixed usage's output of
	nested attributes.

2002-03-12    <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Bug 400 fixed.

	* Servers now should recognize that a file called `das' in a
	directory with data files is an ancillary DAS for any of those
	files. If an ancillary DAS exists that has a more speciific name,
	that file will be used instead of the directory-wide DAS.

2001-10-13  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Merged with release-3-2-8.

	* Various bug fixes.

	* Connect now uses exceptions to signal errors for all network I/O.

2001-10-01  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Changed serialize and deserialize so that they use exceptions to
	signal errors. The return values can be ignored. For backward
	compatibility serialize always returns true and deserialize always
	returns false (even though that's counter intuitive, that's the
	old behavior for `no more data to read').

2001-09-28  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Merged with release 3.2.7. The next merge should use
	release-3-2-7 -j release-3-2.

2001-09-26  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Fixed a bug in the progress indicator's cancel button that
	caused a crash.

	* Fixed the grid() server-side function. This function can be used
	in constraint expressions to *select* parts of Grid variables
	based on the values of their map vectors. Here's an example using
	the COADS dataset: The dataset can be found at:
	http://dcz.dods.org/dods-3.2/nph-dods/data/nc/coads_climatology.nc.
	Look at the DDS and at the Grid SST:
	    Dataset {
		Float64 COADSX[COADSX = 180];
		Float64 COADSY[COADSY = 90];
		Float64 TIME[TIME = 12];
		Grid {
		 ARRAY:
		    Float32 SST[TIME = 12][COADSY = 90][COADSX = 180];
		 MAPS:
		    Float64 TIME[TIME = 12];
		    Float64 COADSY[COADSY = 90];
		    Float64 COADSX[COADSX = 180];
		} SST;
		...
	    } coads_climatology;
	From the attribute object you can find out about the map vector's
	ranges: 
            Attributes {
		COADSX {
		    String units "degrees_east";
		    String modulo " ";
		    String point_spacing "even";
		}
		COADSY {
		    String units "degrees_north";
		    String point_spacing "even";
		}
	    ...
	Using the grid function you can ask for the part of SST that falls
	between 30 and 50 degrees east and greater than 20 degrees north
	using: grid(SST,"30<COADSX<50","20<=COADSY") as the constraint
	expression. Note that two different styles of mini-expressions are
	supported by the function. Requests outside the range of the map
	vectors returns a message indicating their extent.

2001-09-06  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Sequence::deserialize(...) now reads all the sequence values at
	once. Its call semantics are the same as the other classes'
	versions. Values are stored in the Sequence object using a
	vector<BaseType *> for each row (those are themselves held in a
	vector). Three new accessor methods have been added to Sequence
	(row_value() and two versions of var_value()).
	BaseType::deserialize(...) now always returns true. This matches
	with the expectations of most client code (the seqeunce version
	returned false when it was done reading, but all the calls for
	sequences must be changed anyway). If an XDR error is found,
	deserialize throws InternalErr. This fixes bug 258.


2001-08-21  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* After running tests for asciival, I decided to allow some more
	characters in the CE part of a URL. I created id2www_ce which
	allows all the characters in id2www plus [], {}, :, &, <>, = and
	, (comma).

2001-07-27  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* New escaping semantics. The DAP library now supports escaping
	names. Servers (and clients) no longer need to escape characters
	themselves. The functions used to escape characters have been
	changed, too. The old functions escaped chars that could not be
	included in a DAP URL. The new functions only escape chars that
	cannot be present in a URI as defined by RFC 2396 (``Uniform
	Resource Identifiers (URI): Generic Syntax''). The DAP's scanners
	and parsers have been expanded so that many more characters are
	now allowed. The regular expressions used to define IDs and NAMEs
	are: 
	    ID	 [a-zA-Z_/%.][-a-zA-Z0-9_/%.#:+\\]*
	    NAME [a-zA-Z_/%.0-9][-a-zA-Z0-9_/%.#:+\\]*
	These changes mean that datasets which contain IDs with spaces
	will work. Note that a space is not allowed in a URI so it will be
	escaped. If you're typing in a URL to a browser, you must supply
	the %20 escape. However, Connect is smart enough to escape the
	space if it's present in a CE. On the server-side, DODSFilter and
	the type classes remove the escape.

2001-07-10  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* If the `read from a file or stdin' feature of geturl is used and
	the input source cannot be opened, an error message is printed.
	This fixes a bug where a null input data source pointer caused a
	segmentation violation. I also added a throw to
	Connect::read_data() so that other clients that don't test the
	data source pointer (which is a FILE *) will get an exception (as
	opposed to a core file).

2001-06-22  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* I added `#' to the set of characters allowed in IDs. See bug 179.

	* I normalized the definitions of ID, FLOAT and NEVER in the four
	main scanners in the DAP library. They now all share the same set
	of characters except for a few odd outliers.

2001-06-18  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Fixed a bug that crept into the processing of the server's
	version number information in the (client) class DataDDS. This
	made it impossible for clients to process Sequences sent from
	new servers because they we using the old (default)
	deserialization scheme.

2001-06-15  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Merged with release-3-2-4. The next merge should use -j
	release-3-2-4 -j release-3-2.

2001-06-05  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* das.y: Changed the way errors are handled. Many errors still
	cause exceptions to be thrown. However, if an attribtue's value is
	wrong (e.g., a floating point value that is out of range), rather
	than throw an exception a note in the form of a container and
	explanation are added to the attribute table where the error
	occurred. This is particularly important for attributes like
	numerical values since they are often machine-dependent. Here's an
	example of a DAS which contains an error:
	
	Attributes {
	    a {
	        Byte size 7, 700;
		Float64 type 6.02e400, 3.4;
		Float64 type 6.02e400, 2.7, 10e-400;
	    }
        }

	And here is how the DAS looks once it is processed by the
	client-side software:

	Attributes {
	    a {
		Byte size 7;
		a_errors {
		    Byte size 700;
		    String size_explanation `700' is not a Byte value.;
		    Float64 type 6.02e400, 6.02e400, 10e-400;
		    String type_explanation `6.02e400' is not a Float64 value., `6.02e400' is not a Float64 value., `10e-400' is not a Float64 value.;
		}
		Float64 type 3.4, 2.7;
	    }
	}

	* Makefile.in: Added a short script to the Makefile.in so that
	when CppUnit stuff is not defined a message is printed. This is
	only triggered for the unit_tests targets, so it's really a
	reminder for the folks that are doing development.

	* configure.in: Changed so that if CFLGAS/CXXFLAGS are defined
	those values are used instead of the defaults. This simplifies
	development and debugging because it is easier to get builds
	without optimization and with optimal debugging without hand
	editing the Makefile every time configure is run.

2001-05-03  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Added Cache-Control: no-cache header for error responses. This
	will prevent internal server error responses (which look like
	valid responses to the cache) from getting cached.

	* Added support for conditional requests to the DODSFilter class,
	the cgi_util functions and the DODS_Dispatch.pm Perl module.
	Servers can now see conditional requests as such and respond
	sensibly. If a server cannot use the modification time of a file,
	then it should subclass DODSFilter and supply different versions
	of the last modified time methods.

2001-04-23  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Fixed the unit test targets and variables. These are now
	included in the Makefile.in but are commented out. You must
	remove the comments to use the target. Also needed is the CppUnit
	software which is in CVS in the CppUnit module.

	* Added support for the Last-Modified MIME header. All DODS
	servers which use the functions in cgi_util.cc and/or the class
	DODSFilter can now easily include the Last-Modified header in
	their responses. The only change that servers should make is to
	pass the ancillary files location directory to
	DODSFilter::send_data(). Use of the send_das() and send_dds()
	methods should require no change. In addition, calling the
	send_data() method without giving the ancillary files location
	will work OK with the exception that ancillary files won't
	contribute to the LM computation (as they will for the DAS and DDS
	responses).

	Currently the LM computation works only for file-based datasets.
	Servers that provide access to other types of data should subclass
	DODSFilter and provide alternate implementations of the relevant
	methods. 
	
	* Fixed some warnings in Error.cc from g++.

2001-02-13  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Merged authentication changes from the trunk (where that feature
	was added) here so that it can be included in 3.2 without too much
	confusion. 

2001-02-09  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Substantial changes to Connect to support HTTP authentication.
	libdap++ now support three ways of supplying credentials: via
	Connect's ctor, in a URL (using Netscape's convention and via a
	popup. 

2001-01-26  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Merged with release-3-2-3. The next merge should use -j
	release-3-2-3 -j release-3-2.

	* Tagged release-3-2-3

2000-12-06  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* There was an old problem with libwww which I patched in June or
	July which fixed its caching of compressed responses. This patch
	has not made it into the regular distribution, so when I upgraded
	the patch was lost. I've re-applied the patch to the code in
	src/packages/libwww. This, together with the .dodsrc bug fixed
	below, fixes reported problems with the caching system (on unix at
	least, I don't have any information about the problems on win32).

	* Fixed .dodsrc file reading. Comments at the top of the file
	caused the reader to stop processing the file and thus none of the
	parameter values were being read.

2000-12-04  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Note that the attribute table tests added are both unit tests
	(look at the unit_tests target in the Makefile) and dejaGNU-type
	tests. Take a look at AttrTableTest.cc to see how unit tests are
	written for a class.

2000-11-29  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Fixed problems with attribute aliases. Added unit tests for
	AttrTable. DAS is now a child of AttrTable, so the AttrTable
	methods can be used at any level of the DAS object. The DAS
	methods still work, but they are now implemented using AttrTable
	methods. 

2000-09-21  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Merged Jose Garcia's exception handling code. 

	* Merging the exception software means that all definitions of the
	read() method must change. See BaseType.h for details.

	* Improved error messages returned by the parsers. The DAS and DDS
	parsers now include a line number and, in many cases, context, for
	each message. 

	* Normalized all the #ifndef #endif guards in the header files so
	they use the same naming scheme. Added guards around #include
	lines for headers to speed compile times (see Lakos).

	* Reorganized the source files so that the CVS logs appear at the
	end rather than the start of each file. 

2000-09-11  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Added methods to Sequence to provide access to row number
	constraint information. These methods (get_starting_row_number,
	...) provide access to the indices given in a CE. Also added is a
	method to set these values (until explicitly set the stating
	and ending row numbers and the stride are -1). In addition there
	is a method to get the current row number (useful when reading
	row-by-row with read()) and a method to read the ith row into the
	sequence. 

	* Added Sequence row number selection. It is now possible to
	request the first 10 rows of a sequence, or row 7 through 11 and
	to do so using a stride. The notation is the same as for Arrays
	and Grids; it uses the square brackets and colon separated
	integers for start, stride and stop. 

2000-08-31  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Merged with 3.1.10. The next merge should use update -d -j
	release-3-1-10 -j release-3-1.

	* Fixed a bug in all the scanners (except the GSE scanner) where
	\r characters in text sent from win32-hosted servers caused the
	problems. The \r characters are either ignored or treated like
	newlines when paired with \n (depending on the circumstances).

2000-08-29  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Merged with 3.1.9. The next merge should use update -d -j
	release-3-1-9 -j release-3-1.

2000-08-25  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Fixed a bug in esc2underscore(). The function used a static
	instance of Regex; whatever regular expression was passed in on
	the first call would be used for all subsequent calls. The same
	problem existed for other functions in the file.

2000-08-02  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Merged with 3.1.8. The next merge should use cvs update -j
	release-3-1-8 -j release-3-1.

2000-08-02  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Fixed a config_dap.h goof. That header was included by some of
	the DAP headers which might, in turn, be included by other
	software. The HAVE_CONFIG_H symbol in config_dap.h was confusing
	other code (e.g., the Cgicc library). I changed config_dap.h and
	its use; the header is now only included by DAP .cc or .c files.
	DAP header files which needed config_dap.h for the dods_int32,
	etc., typedefs now get those from dods-datatypes.h. Headers which
	used config_dap.h for the DVR symbol (which holds the dap version
	information) have been rewritten.

	This change means that code which now included config_dap.h should
	be rewritten to use the dods-datatypes.h header or otherwise
	changed so that config_dap.h is not used.

2000-06-16  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Note: This release was made to patch a bug which shows up in the
	version of loaddods that supports loading the DAS into a
	structure (version 3.1.5 of loaddods). You need this code to build
	that version of loaddods.

	* Fixed the tests so they work on my machine (where I don't have
	`.' in my PATH). I also added some `/'s in places where is *seems*
	DejaGnu was supplying them before. If extras creep in that should
	not e a problem.

	* Fixed (by Ethan) the tar and binary-tar targets.

	* Added a fair amount of instrumentation to the dtors of various
	methods. 

	* Fixed a bug in DDS. The del_var method must delete the BaseType
	before deleting the list element. I also changes from a SLList to
	a DLList to get a cleaner delete method.

2000-06-07  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Merged with version 3.1.6. Used cvs update -d -j release-3-1-5
	-j release-3-1. The next merge should use -j release-3-1-6 -j
	release-3-1. 

	* Added code to Vector so that each element of vector<BaseType *>
	_vec is explicitly copied and deleted.

	* Fixed bugs in Grid, Structure and Sequence. The methods used to
	get the Pix pointing to the first variable would segfault if there
	were no variables. Now they return 0.

	* DODSFilter now has a set_ce() method. This means that a server
	can easily rewrite the CE it gets without loosing the other
	features of DODSFilter.

	* Connect.cc: Fixed bugs with local connections and the libwww and
	Gui initializations. 

	* Fixed a bug in AttrTable. Container attributes below the top
	level were broken in the last release. Changed the get_attr_num()
	method so that it returns a sensible value for both containers and
	`plain' attributes. Added to struct entry so that it is more a
	complete class. Added methods so that operator= and the copy-ctor
	really work. The IFREMER server needs these fixes.

	* Added to InternalErr a new ctor which makes it simpler to report
	the file name and line number when an error is thrown.

2000-06-06  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Merged changes from Rob's PC port. Used cvs update -j
	pc-port-branch. I have done minimal testing on Linux (dejagnu is
	not yet installed) and the code seems fine. 

2000-04-17  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Fixed two bugs in Connect.cc that caused client sessions which
	mixed remote and local connections to fail.

2000-04-06  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Merged with Brent's gui2 code. This version of the progress
	popup adds a cancel button. The software was checked in on the
	gui2 branch and the point at which it was merged was tagged, on
	that branch, as gui2-0. Future merges should use update -j gui2-0
	-j gui2. 

2000-03-31  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Merged with release-3-1-5. The next merge should use -j
	release-3-1-5 -j release.

2000-03-28  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Look in the Makefile for this software to see the new support
	library configure macros in action. These simplify getting the
	right libraries on the link line without duplicates (which
	lengthen link times). 

	* Added libdap++-gui.a to the build/install/tar/binary-tar stuff.
	This library is built with `GUI-enabled' versions of Connect and
	Error. This is to support our progress indicator and cancel button.

	* Added a new feature to the .dodsrc file and caching. Users can
	set the default expiration time for a response using a parameter
	in the RC file. By default the expiration time is 24 hours
	(written in seconds).

	* Fixed bugs in the caching software. Compressed responses now are
	cached correctly and responses with several variables are also
	correctly handled. 

2000-03-31  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* escaping.cc: Fixed a bug where an int was used to index into a
	string object.

	* parser-util.cc (check_float32): Float32, Float64 attributes no
	longer check ranges.

2000-03-20  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* parser-util.cc (check_byte): Byte attributes can now be either
	signed or not (i.e., their range is -128 to 255). This is to
	support clients that assume bytes to be signed as well as those
	that assume bytes to be unsigned.

2000-01-26  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Merged with release3-1-4. The next merge should use: update -j
	release-3-1-4 -j release-3-1.

2000-01-26  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Fixes for Red hat 6.x (from Ethan).

	* Fixed the use of the stdc++ library's string::find() method. Its
	return type was assigned to an unsigned int in many places. On 64
	bit machines this caused problems. The type now used is
	string::size_type (although size_t also works).

2000-01-24  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Fixed a bug in the DAS and DDS parsers (das.y, dds.y). These
	parsers used static global C++ objects which require that their
	constructors run before main(). However, when the dap library is
	linked by a linker that is not aware of this (e.g., Sun's ld, when
	using GNU C++) those constructors are never called and accessing
	those objects causes a segmentation fault. Fixing this problem
	might fix undiscovered bugs in netCDF clients and definitely fixes
	problems with the nascent loaddods rewrite (where loaddods gets
	rewritten in C++).

1999-12-31  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Added Gui (progress indicator) code back into the core. The
	interpreter is now embedded in DODS. 

1999-12-14  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Fixed a bug in Connect where once the Cache was closed it would
	never be opened again. 

	* Fixes/improvements for the caching code. The code now correctly
	handles the case where many URLs are opened using Connect objects
	created both sequentially and in an interleaved fashion. The Cache
	index is now updated after each URL request. The Cache is now
	closed only after all connect objects are destroyed.

	* Connect.h: Added static members to track use of Connect objects
	in conjunction with the new caching code.

1999-11-04  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Merged: cvs update -j release-3-1-2 -j release-3-1, the next
	merge command should use -j release-3-1-3 -j release-3-1.

1999-11-03  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Fixed the usage filter (nothing to do with the comment about a
	function of the same name in cgi_utils.cc). The filter was slurping
	entire datasets because it failed to append the .html suffix when
	looking for user-defined documentation about a dataset.

	* DDS::send now catches exceptions thrown by the expression
	evaluator. This means more reliable handling of errors from within
	server-side function. However, this is only a stop-gap solution to
	the general problem of poor error processing within the library.
	Look for a *real* solution to this problem in about 2 months.

	* Fixed a range-check bug for unsigned 16-bit integers. The values
	were being tested as if they were signed.

	* Removed usage() from cgi_utils.cc since it was not used and was
	causing conflicts with servers which defined a function with the
	same name.

	* Documentation updates.

	* Substantial changes to the Makefile.in. See the top level ChangeLog.

1999-08-27  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Fixed the value of DODS_SHRT_MIN in dods-limits.h

	* Now compiles with gcc 2.95

1999-05-27  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Misc bug fixes.

	* Error and InternalErr objects now are better behaved and DDS
	throws them more predictably (although there's still a lot of work
	to do there).

	* Fixes merged from the alpha-3-0-0 branch.

1999-05-24  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* The DODS support address is now correct in all the places in the
	dap. 

	* Fixed some bugs that arose because C and C++ I/O streams may no
	longer be synchronized.

	* Dan removed the old GUI code. See the comments in Connect.cc.

1999-05-19  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* The dap++ library now builds using -fPIC (position independent
	code) so sharable libraries should be easier to make.

	* In DODS_Dispatch.pm, variables are checked for odd characters
	that might be used to embed shell commands.

	* Fixed security holes in the DODS_Dispatch.pm code. It now
	returns the command as elements of an array which can be passed to
	the exec() thus by passing the shell.

	* Fixed all occurrences of the support email address to be the new
	address. 

1999-05-04  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Added to DODSFilter and DODS_Dispatch.pm so that server version
	number information can be passed from the CGI script to the core
	software. Now when you ask for the version of a server, you will
	get the server's version information in addition to the core's. In
	addition, the XDODS-Server header that is returned with every
	response will now contain the server's version number. This
	assumes that the server's dispatch script initializes
	DODS_Dispatch correctly.

	* Added InternalErr class. This class should be thrown by any code
	that finds an internal error (i.e., the sort of thing that might
	otherwise be trapped by an assert).

	* Committed changes that form the base of version 3. This combines
	the new simple types with a reduced dependence on the old libg++
	code and misc. fixes. 

1999-04-21  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Small fix in prune_spaces(). This fixed a problem in the mexcdf
	client (and presumably other netcdf or matlab programs to).

1999-04-14  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Fixed a bug in Connection::del_connect() where an assert tested
	false for a valid condition. It is OK for the conns[i] element to
	be NULL when this method is run.

	* Fixed a bug in Connect where the member _tv would be deleted
	without being first allocated when local files are accessed. This
	member is no longer needed (it was used by libwww 5.0).

1999-04-09  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* This release is a special ferret-only release. It is a stable
	alpha version of what will be DODS 3.0 once some more features are
	added. 

1999-03-24  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Added support for the new Int16, UInt16 and Float32 types.

1999-03-22  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Added the Int16, UInt16 and Float32 datatypes to attributes. See
	the tests numbered test.18--20.

1999-03-19  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Added a call to setprecision(15) in geturl. This makes it so
	that floating point numbers will print with the full range or
	precision. It might be that I have to move this when 32 bit floats
	are added because they have lower precision (8). However, setting
	the precision at this level (once, before the calls to print_val()
	start) is probably more efficient.

1999-03-17  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* Changed cgi_util.cc:find_ancillary_file() so that it looks for
	<pathname>.ext in addition to <basename>.ext and the other
	variations. This means that the current convention of naming
	ancillary DAS files <filename>.das will work for both the
	DODS_Date(), etc., functions (whose Factory classes were using
	this convention) and the regular DAS filter program. 

1999-02-24  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.dods.org>

	* An interim revision changed the way incoming data documents were
	processed so that the DDS contained in the data document did not
	have to copied to a separate file before being processed. However,
	this broken programs that read data docs with a pipe. This problem
	has been fixed. The document's DDS still is not copied, but
	programs like asciival that read from stdin via a pipe now work.

1999-01-21  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.cvo.oneworld.com>

	* Added the Grid Selection function. Grid variable may now be
	`selected' based on the values of the Map vectors (since this a
	constraint that returns data based on those data's values, I'm
	calling it a selection operation). The syntax looks like:
	grid(<grid var name>, <expression 0>, <expr 1>, ..., <expr n>). An
	example: grid(dsp_band_1, "29.7 < lat <= 34.8", "lon > -70.9", "
	-60 < lon"). This deliberately shows different forms the
	`expressions' can take. Note that these expressions can only name
	the grid's map vectors; they are not general expressions. Also
	note that the function appears in the projection part of a CE.

1999-01-15  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.cvo.oneworld.com>

	* Changed the way the expression and DDS parsers work. Now the
	expression scanner/parser can process strings directly. This means
	that expression parsing is cleaner, somewhat faster and more
	reliable since a temporary file is no longer created as part of
	the parse process. Similarly, the DDS parser no longer requires
	that a temporary file be created to parse the DDS bound to a data
	document. 

1998-11-23  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.cvo.oneworld.com>

	* Fixed a bug in DAS where the destructor would free memory that
	was just garbage. I replaced the old genclass-based DASVHMap code
	with an SLList of structs.

1998-11-11  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.cvo.oneworld.com>

	* Fixes for various memory leaks found while working on the FF
	server.

1998-11-05  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.cvo.oneworld.com>

	* Fixed error messages for CEs involving arrays. When an array
	name was misspelled in a CE you got no error message, now you do.

1998-10-21  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.cvo.oneworld.com>

	* Added projection functions to the CE syntax. These functions are
	executed *during* the parse of the projection clause. They can be
	used to add new (synthetic) variables to the DDS.

1998-10-14  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.cvo.oneworld.com>

	* expr.y: Added parse of single array indeces to the projection
	list in a CE. i[3] asks for the fourth element of the array i. The
	old syntax i[3:3] still works.

1998-09-17  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.cvo.oneworld.com>

	* The release (version 2.18) is the last that will use String.h.
	  WRONG! 11/11/98 jhrg
	
1998-09-03  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.cvo.oneworld.com>

	* Feature: CEs no longer require fully-qualified names for fileds
	of ctor types.

	* Makefile.in (clean): Added GNU to the list of directories
	cleaned. This prevents sending out .o files with the source code.

1998-04-07  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.cvo.oneworld.com>

	* Fixed Connect: leading spaces in a URL and/or CE caused either a
	crash or other problem.

1998-04-03  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.cvo.oneworld.com>

	* Added patches from Jake Hamby which fix various problems with
	Sequences. 

1998-03-27  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.cvo.oneworld.com>

	* Added targets for test coverage analysis.

	* Added fix from Jake Hamby.

	* Makefile.in (GNUHDRS): Added String.h & String.cc to the
	distributions. 

1998-03-19  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.cvo.oneworld.com>

	* Added error messages when array indices are out of range.

	* Fixed yesterday's fix... Error objects are no longer compressed.
	I moved compression into DDS::send (from DODSFilter::send_data)
	and structured send() so that the mime header generators no longer
	use a hack to write themselves without compression. Previously
	set_mime_*() used to `write past' the compressor process and this
	caused synchronization problems - which I tried to fix yesterday.
	Now the headers are written and then the compressor is opened. 

1998-03-18  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.cvo.oneworld.com>

	* Fixed an ugly bug where Error objects were compressed (sometimes
	they still are) but the return MIME document header didn't say so.
	Now the return document header says if the Error object is
	compressed. Note that compressing Error objects is not going to
	save any (real) space but once the compressing data sink is set up
	*whatever* gets written to it will be compressed...

1998-03-17  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.cvo.oneworld.com>

	* Added the ASCII filter to the set of things that comprise a DODS
	server. Use .ascii or .asc as a URL suffix to get comma-separated
	ASCII data back from a DODS server.

	* Added boolean member functions is_simple_type(),
	is_vector_type() and is_constructor_type(). This reduce the size
	of various parts of the code (but I have not gone through and
	replaced all the old code yet).

	* Added some new mfuncs to the core. element_count() returns the
	number of elements in a constructor type (one for a simple type).

1998-03-09  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.cvo.oneworld.com>

	* Removed the -fno-rtti flag from the DAP library build. The
	library needs RTTI so that software written using exceptions can
	catch derived exception classes.

1998-02-11  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.cvo.oneworld.com>

	* Added the DODS_Cache.pm class (which was in the hdf-dods server
	code only). This Perl module is not installed as part of the
	default stuff in DODS_ROOT/etc.

	* Added support for compression. Servers recognize the
	Accept-Encoding header in a request document. when the value of
	that header is `deflate' the zlib LZW algorithm is used to
	compress data. Clients automatically respond to document that
	contain the header Content-Encoding: deflate by un compressing the
	data (a new feature of libwww 5.1). The new servers are compatible
	with old clients and the new clients are compatible with old
	servers (although neither combination can use compression).

	* Added a help option to the servers (via an addition in
	DODS_Dispatch.pm). Use this with the `file name' /help or the
	extension .help.

Tue Dec 16 00:32:31 1997  James Gallagher  <jimg@localhost>

	* Added DODS_Dispatch.pm perl class. This class centralizes a lot
	of the code that used to be replicated in each of the perl scripts
	used to dispatch the various `methods' of a DODS server.

Mon Dec 15 17:26:37 1997  James Gallagher  <jimg@localhost>

	* Many small bug fixes that were fixed before being added to the
	TODO list.

	* Added DataDDS class which makes the version number read by
	Connect available to any member function that can access a DDS
	pointer (since DDS *s can reference DataDDS objects).

	* Added the DODSFilter class to simplify writing servers that
	conform to a set of standards Re: the placement and naming of
	ancillary files, version numbers, etc.

	* Added new Sequence processing code along with backward
	compatibility. Nested sequences are sent more efficiently. In
	addition, sequences may be followed by other variables in a Data
	object (an old bug).

	* Added new characters to those allowed in DDS NAME lexeme. This
	means that a file with _ and . in the name will parse.

Wed Aug 20 14:12:54 1997  James Gallagher  <jimg@localhost>

	* Added newline after data in process_data() in geturl.cc.

Thu Jun  5 16:08:10 1997  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.cvo.oneworld.com>

	* See TODO for a list of reported bugs fixed and outstanding.

	* Changed the way request_data works so that Connect can now be
	used to create clients that read not only from the network but
	also from standard input.

	* Wrote DODS_Dispatch.pm Perl `class' that can be used to write
	the nph-* dispatch scripts. This should simplify maintenance of
	those scripts since they was a lot of replication of code from one
	script to another. Now must of the real functionality is
	concentrated in the one file.

	* When projections on Grids result in an object that is no longer
	a `true' Grid (no longer satisfies Grid::check_semantics()) then
	send the resulting variables as a Structure of Arrays or a simple
	array (the latter if only one array remains after applying the
	projection to the Grid.

	* Changed the way servers report the version number of the core
	software. The message is now generated by the *_dods data filter
	program using its -v option (all the data filter programs
	support this option). This gets rid of the dods-core-version perl
	script. 

	* Changed geturl so that it can read from stdin (similar to
	writeval). 

	* Fixed bugs in util.cc.

Wed May 21 22:25:41 1997  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.cvo.oneworld.com>

	* See the TODO list for information on bugs found and fixed.

	* Added DAS aliases and hierarchies.

Sun Mar 23 17:01:12 1997  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.cvo.oneworld.com>

	* Fixed the nasty decompression bug where child process exit
	status was never caught. This caused process tables to fill, etc.

Thu Mar  6 21:14:38 1997  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.cvo.oneworld.com>

	* See TODO list for bugs fixed.

Sun Feb  9 18:40:25 1997  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.cvo.oneworld.com>

	* See TODO for a list of bugs fixed.

Thu Feb  6 16:17:06 1997  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.cvo.oneworld.com>

	* Changed the return type of request_data() from DDS & to DDS *.
	Also changed the return types of append_constraint() and
	constraint_dds() from DDS & to DDS *. When request_data()
	encounters an error it no longer exits; now it returns NULL.

Wed Dec 18 11:18:05 1996  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.cvo.oneworld.com>

	* Version 2.10 prepared

Wed Dec 11 20:15:10 1996  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.cvo.oneworld.com>

	* Created the Usage server.

	* Fixed bugs in cgi_util.cc - error Content-Description items were
	not processed.

Tue Dec  3 09:43:02 1996  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.cvo.oneworld.com>

	* Added to DDS::parse_constraint() two new variables: ostream os
	and bool server. These are used to control processing of error
	messages that are returned from the CE parser. Rather than have
	the CE parser write all its error messages to stderr, the parser
	now returns an error object. The new code in parse_constraint()
	ensures that an `error' header is written to OS and that the error
	object is serialized if the member function is run from within a
	server. Since parse_constraint() is called from within
	DDS::send(), users of the library don't need to do anything
	different unless they have coded their own versions of send().

	* Added code to ensure that variables can be used in the selection
	part of a constraint expression without having to be also in the
	projection part. This means that a CE can be used to request a
	single variable (e.g., the sequence `s') but select by comparing
	to other variables in the data set.

Mon Dec  2 11:50:29 1996  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.cvo.oneworld.com>

	* Added three new versions of int_ops to process all the possible
	permutations of signed and unsigned integer operands. Ignore the
	warnings in util.cc about comparisons between signed and unsigned.

	* Added cases for unsigned integer variables in the Vector, Byte,
	Int and Float classes. Also added cases in BaseType and some of
	the Test* classes. This fixes problems with the processing of
	this type.

Wed Nov 27 11:02:44 1996  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.cvo.oneworld.com>

	* Added DDS as a third argument to the user-defined functions in
	the CE evaluator. This means that a function (which may be server
	specific) may look at the value of any variable in the dataset,
	not just those values passed as parameters. This will facilitate
	creation of functions which use implicit relations between
	variables when computing values or performing selections (e.g.,
	when geo-location information depends on the implicit relation
	between two or more arrays).

	* Changed the way Makefile dependencies are processed so that
	Makefile (re)generation is faster (since dependencies rarely
	change). 

Sun Nov 24 19:45:22 1996  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.cvo.oneworld.com>

	* Tested the library code in a number of situations and fixed many
	little bugs.

	* The asynchronous mode for data transfers is broken and is never
	used. 

	* Significantly improved processing of errors - web errors are now
	handled correctly for the DAS and DDS - alas the data will still
	exit when an error is encountered. Note that to fix this problem
	I'll need to use exceptions *or* change the return type of the
	request_data() member function to DDS * (from DDS &). Either one
	will break everyone's code...

	* Fixed the lame-looking progress indicator.

	* dods_root is no longer a global variable that depends on run
	time initialization from g++; now it is a function. This ensures
	that the core software can be linked to program core using linkers
	other than g++.

	* Added better compressor function - look at jg_dods.cc to see how
	it is used.

	* Fixed broken decompression.

Wed Nov 13 10:43:56 1996  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.cvo.oneworld.com>

	* Added error MIME headers to the set that can be generated by
	helper functions in cgi_util.cc. The error headers are necessary
	since DODS now must generate all its own MIME headers (see the
	section on NPH CGIs in the CGI spec). MIME error headers should be
	used when an http or www error has been detected - don't use the
	DODS error objects in those cases.

	* Made changes in the Int data types so that expressions with
	UInt32s should work. 

	* Fixed some problems with the GUI. It should work more reliably
	but I doubt that all the problems have been fixed. Needs testing.

	* Now reports most www/http errors, although some clients still
	can't seem to get the GUI to work (e.g., writeval) even though
	geturl can.

	* Now requires version 5.0a of the WWW Library.

	* Many changes based on feedback from the initial version 2.09
	distribution. 

Tue Oct 29 08:23:30 1996  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.cvo.oneworld.com>

	* Added UInt32 (32 bit unsigned integers) to the DAP. This
	includes both using them in the DDS and the DAS. When an UInt32 is
	used as an operand in a CE, the other operand is cast to unsigned
	for the comparison operation.

Fri Oct 18 09:35:07 1996  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.cvo.oneworld.com>

	* Fixed various errors in the new Unsigned int classes.

	* Changed the operation of Connect::request_das() and
	request_dds(). They now pass any initial constraint along to the
	respective servers. An initial constraint is one which is supplied
	along with the URL at the time the Connect object is made.

	* The functions set_mine_{text,binary} now produce complete
	HTTP/MIME headers. Thus DODS servers can now be invoked using the
	`nph' feature of CGI 1.1 (done by naming the DODS server dispatch
	script `nph-*'). This solve two problems which appeared with large
	data transfers: Transfers were cut-off before completion when a
	server-determined timeout period elapsed and 2) Some large
	transmissions had an extra byte added into the data stream.

Tue Oct  8 09:23:57 1996  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.cvo.oneworld.com>

	* Modified geturl so that CEs can be passed in using ? in the URL
	in addition to the program's -c option.

	* Added `%' to the set of characters allowable in identifiers.

	* Added code so that a constraint expression appended to a URL is
 	properly handled. The CE is stored in in the Connect object. When
	a CE is passed to the request_data member function, Connect
	correctly combines the projection and selection parts of that CE
	with the matching parts of any initial CE. 

	* Fixed up the grammar files for Bison 1.25

Thu Sep 12 14:05:49 1996  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.cvo.oneworld.com>

	* Added a new option to geturl; -D which can be used to get data. 

	* Fixed Array::print_array; used indirectly by the new option to
	geturl. 

Mon Aug 26 13:18:21 1996  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.cvo.oneworld.com>

	* Fixed various configure.in files so that the different size ints
	are defined properly.

	* Fixed up the config_dap.h problem in the jg-dods directory.

	* Added classes for 32 bit floats, 32 bit unsigned ints and 16 bit
	signed and unsigned ints. These are *not* built by default - I'll
	let the various users have a chance to include these new classes in
	their software before they are added to the build (and thus must
	be sub-classed by users of the DAP).

Fri Aug 16 09:34:00 1996  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.cvo.oneworld.com>

	* Fixed configure tests for sem.h prototypes and the semctl union.
	A new test which scans the sem.h header is in aclocal.m4 (in etc)
	and the configure script uses that test.

Tue Aug 13 10:54:02 1996  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.cvo.oneworld.com>

	* Fixed bugs in Grid: bad constraint expressions would cause core
	dumps and a bug on the SGI (maybe others) where valid Grids would
	not parse.

	* Added to the Error class so that its methods are more useful
	for correcting errors and displaying messages (see Error.cc).

	* Switched to parser_arg object on all the parsers. parser_arg is
	a simple object used to pass values to and from the bison gnerated
	parsers. You need bison 1.24 or newer.

	* Added _unused_ to config_dap.h; this macro expands to gcc's
	__attribute__((__unused__)) thing. I then tacked `__unused__' on the
	char rcsid[] arrays to suppress warnings from gcc -Wall (and
	highlite the warnings that should be fixed!)

	* Fixed a bug in Clause where non-existent functions were
	evaluated - this caused a core dump.

Fri Aug  9 10:21:06 1996  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.cvo.oneworld.com>

	* Fixed bug in Connect where local accesses were not correctly
	detected. Also modified geturl to print a diagnostic when supplied
	with a local file name (or, more to the point, a name without
	`http'). 

Wed Jul 17 15:04:01 1996  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.cvo.oneworld.com>

	* Added expr-check target in Makefile.

	* Added new tests for das, dds objects. Added tests for expr-test
	driver. 

Mon Jul  8 16:25:11 1996  James Gallagher  <jimg@dcz.cvo.oneworld.com>

	* Gui.cc: Added compile-time switch HAVE_EXPECT which is used to
	control use/requirement of expect and tcl. When defined as 1 Expect
	and Tcl are used to communicate with a GUI subprocess. When 0,
	Expect and Tcl are not used (thus the libraries are not required).
	Note that without Expect the GUI used for the transmission
	progress indicator and error reporting is not available.
