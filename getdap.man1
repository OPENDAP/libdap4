.SH DESCRIPTION
.B getdap
In the first form of the command, dereference the URL and
perform the requested operations. This includes routing
the returned information through the DAP processing
library (parsing the returned objects, et c.). If none
of a, d, or D are used with a URL, then the DAP library
routines are NOT used and the URLs contents are dumped
to standard output.

In the second form of the command, assume the files are
DataDDS objects (stored in files or read from pipes)
and process them as if -D were given. In this case the
information *must* contain valid MIME header in order
to be processed.
.SH OPTIONS

For each URL, get the server version.
.IP -d
For each URL, get the the DDS.
.IP -a
For each URL, get the the DAS.
.IP -D

.IP -x

.IP -z
