/** Singleton to handle signals. This class adapts the C-style function call
    interface to one suited for C++. This class records a signal's old
    action/handler when it installs new handler. When a signal is caught, the
    new handler (registered with this class) is run and then the old
    action/handler is performed. This ensures that when libdap++ is embedded
    in code which has a handler for a signal such as SIGINT which does
    something other than the default, that thing, whatever it may be, gets
    done.

    This class treats signals it registers (using the EventHandler abstract
    class) differently than ones registered using the \c signal() or \c
    sigaction() system interfaces. If the register_handler() method is called
    and an instance of EventHandler is already bound to \e signum, then the
    old EventHandler is returned. However, if there's an existing handler
    that was set up with \c sigaction(), ..., it won't be returned. Instead
    it will either be run after the newly registered EventHandler or ignored,
    depending on register_handler()'s \e override parameter. This feature may
    be used only for POSIX.1 signals which cause process termination. They
    are: SIGHUP, SIGINT, SIGKILL, SIGPIPE, SIGALRM, SIGTERM, SIGUSR1, and
    SIGUSR2.
