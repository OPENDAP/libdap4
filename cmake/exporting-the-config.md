Yes — if you want **downstream projects** (i.e., other software that uses `libdap`) to find your configuration and build environment easily, you can set up `libdap` to export a proper **CMake package config**. This includes:

1. Exported targets like `libdap`, `libdapclient`, etc.
2. An installable `libdapConfig.cmake` (or `libdapTargets.cmake`)
3. Optionally: propagate detected configuration results (e.g., presence of `HAVE_LIBXML2`)

---

## ✅ Goal: Let downstreams do this cleanly

```cmake
find_package(libdap REQUIRED)

target_link_libraries(my_tool PRIVATE libdap::libdap)
```

---

## 🔧 Step-by-Step: Exporting `libdap` for Downstream Use

### 1. 📦 Define targets with proper names and namespaces

In your top-level `CMakeLists.txt`, rename your targets to match what you want to export:

```cmake
add_library(libdap::parsers ALIAS parsers)
add_library(libdap::dap ALIAS dap)
add_library(libdap::dapclient ALIAS dapclient)
add_library(libdap::dapserver ALIAS dapserver)
```

You already define `parsers`, `dap`, etc., so this just adds namespaced aliases.

---

### 2. 🛠 Mark installable targets

Ensure your libraries and headers are installed:

```cmake
install(TARGETS dap dapclient dapserver
        EXPORT libdapTargets
        LIBRARY DESTINATION lib
        ARCHIVE DESTINATION lib
        INCLUDES DESTINATION include)

install(DIRECTORY ${CMAKE_CURRENT_SOURCE_DIR}/include/
        DESTINATION include/libdap
        FILES_MATCHING PATTERN "*.h")
```

Also install generated headers if applicable.

---

### 3. 🧱 Export targets to a CMake package

Add:

```cmake
# Install export set (target definitions)
install(EXPORT libdapTargets
        FILE libdapTargets.cmake
        NAMESPACE libdap::
        DESTINATION lib/cmake/libdap)
```

This creates a `libdapTargets.cmake` file that downstreams can import.

---

### 4. 🧩 Generate and install `libdapConfig.cmake`

In your `CMakeLists.txt`:

```cmake
include(CMakePackageConfigHelpers)

write_basic_package_version_file(
    "${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/libdapConfigVersion.cmake"
    VERSION ${LIBDAP_VERSION}
    COMPATIBILITY SameMajorVersion
)

configure_package_config_file(
    "${CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR}/cmake/libdapConfig.cmake.in"
    "${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/libdapConfig.cmake"
    INSTALL_DESTINATION lib/cmake/libdap
)

install(FILES
    "${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/libdapConfig.cmake"
    "${CMAKE_CURRENT_BINARY_DIR}/libdapConfigVersion.cmake"
    DESTINATION lib/cmake/libdap)
```

---

### 5. ✍️ Create `libdapConfig.cmake.in`

Create:

```
cmake/libdapConfig.cmake.in
```

Contents:

```cmake
@PACKAGE_INIT@

include("${CMAKE_CURRENT_LIST_DIR}/libdapTargets.cmake")
```

You can optionally add logic to expose variables like `HAVE_LIBXML2` or `UUID_LIB` too — but these should be opt-in unless they’re part of the public API.

---

## 🧪 Final Directory Structure After Install

Your install tree will contain:

```
lib/
├── libdap.so
├── cmake/
│   └── libdap/
│       ├── libdapTargets.cmake
│       ├── libdapConfig.cmake
│       └── libdapConfigVersion.cmake
include/
└── libdap/
    └── (headers)
```

---

## 🔍 What Downstream Projects Do

They can now do:

```cmake
find_package(libdap REQUIRED)

target_link_libraries(myapp PRIVATE libdap::dap)
```

And CMake will automatically find `libdapConfig.cmake` if installed in a standard location (like `/usr/local/`), or via:

```bash
cmake -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=/opt/libdap ..
```

---

## ✅ Optional: Export detection results (e.g., HAVE\_STRFTIME)

If your downstream needs `config.h`-style values, you can:

* Install `libdapConfig.h` (a sanitized version of `config.h`)
* Or provide `libdapOptions.cmake` for optional values

But that’s usually best for tightly coupled consumers.

---

Would you like me to generate this as a `Findlibdap.cmake` for consumers that don’t use `find_package(CONFIG)` mode? Or help wrap the config header export too?
