Building the DAP library and geturl client program:

0) Skim Requirements, Suggestions and Notes before reporting problems.
   Thanks. 

1) Type `./configure' at the system prompt. On some systems you may have to
   type `sh configure'.

2) Type `make' to build the library, `make check' to build the test software.
   NB: you must have the GNU automated testing software DejaGNU to run the
   makefile's check target.

3) Type `make install' to install the DAP library.

Requirements:

1) Before building this software, you must have built and installed the
   DODS-packages software. The packages software consists of the WWW library
   and other libraries not universally available that DODS uses. To build
   that software, see its INSTALL file. To get that software, see the DODS
   web page http://unidata.ucar.edu/packages/dods/.

2) You must have gcc/g++ 2.8.1 or greater. We do build DODS with egcs on some
   platforms. You'll also need to get the stdc++ library that matches the
   compiler (whatever version). NB: gcc 2.7.x *won't* build DODS.

3) To build from the sources you'll also need bison 1.25 and flex 2.5.4. IF
   you don't have those you can get the lex.*.c and *.tab.c files from
   somewhere else. However, both flex and bison are very easy to build.

4) You *should* get GNU Make. DODS *may* build with other makes, but we know
   it won't build with many standard versions.

Suggestions:

1) If you are building on a new platform (one we don't supply binaries for),
   please run the tests and tell us about any failures. To do this you'll
   need to get the GNU test system called DejaGNU. It is very simple to
   install so don't be shy!

2) If you are developing code that uses DODS, get autoconf and CVS (both from
   GNU). We maintain a CVS-managed source tree that people outside the group
   may access.

Notes:

1) When you unpack the DODS-dap-<version>.tar.gz tar file, it will build a
   directory tree rooted in the directory where you do the unpacking. The
   top of that tree is called `DODS' and you should see that directory once
   tar is done unpacking. In the rest of this file I'll refer to the root of
   that tree as $DODS_ROOT. For example, if you unpacked the tar file in
   /export/jimg then $DODS_ROOT would be /exprt/jimg/DODS.

2) By default DODS installs into its own tree. That is, it does *not* install
   programs in to /usr/local/bin, libraries into /usr/local/lib, etc.
   Instead, programs are installed into $DODS_ROOT/bin, libraries into
   $DODS_ROOT/lib, etc. 

3) Older versions of Linux have an xdr.h include file that won't compile
   properly with g++. The error shows up when building software that calls
   xdr_destroy and the compiler complains that its being called with too many
   arguments. If this happens to you, take the xdr.h.linux file and put it in
   $DODS_ROOT/include and rename it to xdr.h. In that include directory, only
   DODS software will be able to see the changed file (so you can be sure
   that other software that uses the original xdr.h will still build). Note
   that the changes are very minor and there should be no problem installing
   xdr.h in /usr/include/rpc if that's what you want to do.

4) To build with program instrumentation use `--enable-debug=<level>' where
   <level> is 1 or 2. 

5) To build with memory leak checks use --enable-dbnew. You must have the
   freely available libraries libdbnew.a and libefence.a to make use of this
   option.

The defaults for both debug and dbnew are to *not* include those
features. Thus, if you want to built a straight version of the libraries (and
test code), use `./configure'. If you want the extra features, use
`./configure --enable-dbnew --enable-debug=2'

Debugging aids in the DODS API:

DBG: simple program instrumentation -- see the file debug.h in
$DODS_ROOT/include for more information

DBG2: more elaborate program instrumentation -- by convention this is used
for output that is half a page or more, while DEBUG is used for single line
output.

dbnew: include -ldbnew and -lefence when linking. libdbnew.a contains
overloaded versions of new, new[] delete and delete[]. It also contains code
to `walk the malloc chain' and simple checks for out-of-bounds errors.

efence: a freely available bounds checker for dynamically allocated
memory. When used with dbnew, efence must be set to 8-byte alignment. efence
will find all over- or under-writes of dynamically allocated memory, but only
works on some machines.
