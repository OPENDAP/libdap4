# More fixes after resolving conflicts. This code still fails some tests.

# Revision 1.6.10.1  2003/10/03 16:26:30  jimg
# Fixed tests; I changed the text of das-test just a little and so these
# had to be updated. I wanted to be sure that the error message was from
# an exception and not just a write to stderr.

# These changes have already been checked in once before. However, I
# corrupted the source repository and restored it from a 5/9/96 backup
# tape. The previous version's log entry should cover the changes.
