# Revision 1.10  2003/12/11 01:08:38  jimg
# More fixes after resolving conflicts. This code still fails some tests.
#
# Revision 1.9.10.1  2003/10/03 16:26:30  jimg
# Fixed tests; I changed the text of das-test just a little and so these
# had to be updated. I wanted to be sure that the error message was from
# an exception and not just a write to stderr.
#
# Revision 1.9  2000/09/22 02:52:59  jimg
# Fixes to the tests to recognize some of the new error messages. Also,
# the test drivers were modified to catch the exceptions now thrown by
# some of the parsers.
#
# Revision 1.8  2000/06/16 18:15:01  jimg
# Merged with 3.1.7
#
# Revision 1.7.10.1  2000/06/15 02:24:57  jimg
# Fixed the tests: problems with PATH, etc. broke the tests on my new machine
#
# Revision 1.7  1999/03/24 23:42:23  jimg
# Added or updated for the new simple types (Int16, UInt16 and Float32)
#
# Revision 1.6  1997/05/13 23:29:30  jimg
# *** empty log message ***
#
# Revision 1.5  1997/03/27 18:20:02  jimg
# Update for version 2.13
#
# Revision 1.4  1996/11/13 19:23:47  jimg
# *** empty log message ***
#
# Revision 1.3  1996/08/12 22:22:21  jimg
# Changed for the new error message text from the parser.
#
# Revision 1.2  1996/05/14 15:40:54  jimg
# These changes have already been checked in once before. However, I
# corrupted the source repository and restored it from a 5/9/96 backup
# tape. The previous version's log entry should cover the changes.
#
# Revision 1.1  1995/02/16  15:34:53  jimg
# Added these tests. See comments in files in parent directory.
