On OSX valgrind does not work but Apple provides a command line tool
called 'leaks' which can be used to find leaked memory, esp. with
unit tests.

NB: leaks seems to require static linkage.

    linkage     build       leaks   time
    static      serial      no      10-11s
    static      parallel    no      4.6-4.7s
    static      serial      yes     12-13s
    static      parallel    yes     10-5s

    dynamic     serial      yes     fail*
    dynamic     parallel    yes     fail*
    dynamic     serial      no      10-11
    dynamic     parallel    no      4.8

* Either all the tests fail or they fail in a random pattern; leaks
seems to need to be statically linked to work with the CppUnit-based
tests.

So, from this I think static linkage is no slower than dynamic for these
tests and enables us to use the leaks tool on OSX.
