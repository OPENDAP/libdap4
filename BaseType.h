/** This defines the basic data type features for the DODS data access
    protocol (DAP) data types. All the DAP type classes (Float64, Array,
    etc.) subclass it. This class is an abstract one; no variables will ever
    be stored as BaseType instances, only as instances of its child classes.

    These classes and their methods give a user the capacity to set up
    sophisticated data types. They do <i>not</i> provide sophisticated ways to
    access and use this data. On the server side, in many cases, the class
    instances will have no data in them at all until the
    <tt>serialize</tt> function
    is called to send data to the client. On the client side, most DAP
    application programs will unpack the data promptly into whatever local
    data structure the programmer deems the most useful.

    In order to use these classes on the server side of a DAP
    client/server connection, you must write a <tt>read</tt> method
    for each of the data types you expect to encounter in the
    application. This function, whose purpose is to read data from a
    local source into the class instance data buffer, is called in
    <tt>serialize</tt>, when the data is about to be sent to the
    client.  The <tt>read</tt> function may be called earlier, in the
    case of data subset requests (constraint expressions) whose
    evaluation requires it. (For example, the constraint expression
    ``<tt>a,b&b>c</tt>'' requires that <tt>c</tt> be read even though
    it will not be sent.)

    For some data types, the <tt>read</tt> function must be aware of
    the constraints
    to be returned. These cautions are outlined where they occur.

	@note This class is ued by both DAP2 and DAP4.

        composite classes are those made up of aggregated simple data types.
        Array, Grid, and Structure are composite types, while Int and Float are
        simple types. This function is only used by composite classes. The
        BaseType implementation always returns null.

        Several of the subclasses provide alternate access methods
        that make sense for that particular data type. For example,
        the Array class defines a <tt>*var(int i)</tt> method that
        returns the ith entry in the Array data, and the Structure
        provides a <tt>*var(Vars_iter)</tt> function using a
        pseudo-index to access the different members of the structure.

        @brief Returns a pointer to a member of a constructor class.
        @param name The name of the class member.  Defaults to ""
        @param exact_match True if only interested in variables whose
        full names match \e n exactly. If false, returns the first
        variable whose name matches \e name. For example, if \e name
        is \c x and \c point.x is a variable, then var("x", false)
        would return a BaseType pointer to \c point.x. If \e
        exact_match was <tt>true</tt> then \e name would need to be \c
        "point.x" for var to return that pointer. This feature
        simplifies constraint expressions for datasets which have
        complex, nested, constructor variables. Defaults to true.
        @param s Record the path to \e name. Defaults to null, in
        which case it is not used.
        @return A pointer to the member named in the \e n argument. If
        no name is given, the function returns the first (only)
        variable. For example, an Array has only one variable, while a
