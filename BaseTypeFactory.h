/** A factory to create instances of the leaf nodes of BaseType (Byte, ...
    Grid). Clients of libdap++ which require special behavior for the types
    should subclass this factory and provide an implementation which creates
    instances of those specializations. Make sure to pass a reference to the
    new factory to DDS's constructor since by default it uses this factory.

    To define and use your own factory, first make sure that you are not
    using the compile time constant 'DEFAULT_BASETYPE_FACTORY.' Then pass a
    pointer to an instance of your factory to the DDS/DataDDS constructors.
    When the parser is used to build a DDS from a DAP response, the factory
    will be used to instantiate the different variable-type classes.

    @note The easiest way to subclass this is to follow the pattern of using
    a separate class declaration and implementation. It's possible to use one
    file to hold
    both, but that is complicated somewhat because DDS.h, which includes this
    class, also includes many of the type classes (Array.h, ..., Grid.h) and
    the order of their inclusion can create compilation problems where the
    Vector and/or Constructor base classes are not defined. It's easiest to
    split the declaration and implementation and include forward declarations
    of the type classes in the declaration (\c .h) file and then include the
    type class' headers in the implementation (\c .cc) file.
