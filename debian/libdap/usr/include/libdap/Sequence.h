// Interface for the class Sequence. A sequence contains a single set
// of variables, all at the same lexical level just like a structure
// (and like a structure, it may contain other ctor types...). Unlike
// a structure, a sequence defines a pattern that is repeated N times
// for a sequence of N elements. Thus, Sequence { String name; Int32
// age; } person; means a sequence of N persons where each contain a
// name and age. The sequence can be arbitrarily long (i.e., you don't
// know N by looking at the sequence declaration.

/** This is the interface for the class Sequence. A sequence contains
 a single set of variables, all at the same lexical level just like
 a Structure.  Like a Structure, a Sequence may contain other
 compound types, including other Sequences.  Unlike a Structure, a
 Sequence defines a pattern that is repeated N times for a sequence
 of N elements. It is useful to think of a Sequence as representing
 a table of values (like a relational database), with each row of
 the table corresponding to a Sequence ``instance.''  (This usage
 can be confusing, since ``instance'' also refers to a particular
 item of class Sequence.)  For example:

 <pre>
 Sequence {
 String name;
 Int32 age;
 } person;
 </pre>

 This represents a Sequence of ``person'' records, each instance of
 which contains a name and an age:

 <pre>
 Fred       34
 Ralph      23
 Andrea     29
 ...
 </pre>

 A Sequence can be arbitrarily long, which is to say that its
 length is not part of its declaration.  A Sequence can contain
 other Sequences:

 <pre>
 Sequence {
 String name;
 Int32 age;
 Sequence {
 String friend;
 } friend_list;
 } person;
 </pre>

 This is still represented as a single table, but each row contains
 the elements of both the main Sequence and the nested one:

 <pre>
 Fred       34     Norman
 Fred       34     Andrea
 Fred       34     Ralph
 Fred       34     Lisa
 Ralph      23     Norman
 Ralph      23     Andrea
 Ralph      23     Lisa
 Ralph      23     Marth
 Ralph      23     Throckmorton
 Ralph      23     Helga
 Ralph      23     Millicent
 Andrea     29     Ralph
 Andrea     29     Natasha
 Andrea     29     Norman
 ...        ..     ...
 </pre>

 Internally, the Sequence is represented by a vector of vectors. The
 members of the outer vector are the members of the Sequence. This
 includes the nested Sequences, as in the above example.

 NB: Note that in the past this class had a different behavior. It held
 only one row at a time and the deserialize(...) method had to be called
 from within a loop. This is <i>no longer true</i>. Now the
 deserailize(...) method should be called once and will read the entire
 sequence's values from the server. All the values are now stored in an
 instance of Sequence, not just a single row's.

 Because the length of a Sequence is indeterminate, there are
 changes to the behavior of the functions to read this class of
 data.  The <tt>read()</tt> function for Sequence must be written so that
 successive calls return values for successive rows of the Sequence.

 Similar to a C structure, you refer to members of Sequence
 elements with a ``.'' notation.  For example, if the Sequence has
 a member Sequence called ``Tom'' and Tom has a member Float32
 called ``shoe_size'', you can refer to Tom's shoe size as
 ``Tom.shoe_size''.

 @note This class contains the 'logic' for both the server- and client-side
 behavior. The field \e d_values is used by the client-side methods to store
 the entire Sequence. On the server-side, the read() method uses an underlying
 data system to read one row of data values which are then serialized using the
 serialize() methods of each variable.

 @todo Add an isEmpty() method which returns true if the Sequence is
 empty. This should work before and after calling deserialize().
